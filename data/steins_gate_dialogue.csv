???|Hey, what are you mumbling about?
???|Okarin? Earth to Okarin!
???|You talking to someone?
Rintaro|...No, I was just talking to someone. Everything’s fine. I’m about to infiltrate the assembly hall.
Rintaro|Yeah, Doctor Nakabachi got the jump on us, but I’ll make sure he tells us everything.
Rintaro|What!? The Organization is already on the move!?
Rintaro|I see... so that’s the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo.
Mayuri|Who was that on the phone?
Rintaro|If I told you, I’d have to kill you.
Mayuri|Oh, wow. Thanks, Okarin!
Mayuri|Okarin! Okarin!
Rintaro|How many times do I have to tell you? Don’t call me Okarin.
Mayuri|Huh? But I’ve always called you that.
Rintaro|That was then! I have since become Hououin Kyouma, the insane mad scientist hunted by secret organizations the world over. Muhahaha!
Mayuri|But that’s too hard to remember.
Mayuri|And besides, it doesn’t even sound like Okabe Rintaro. You’re weird, ehehe!
Mayuri|So, Okarin, can I ask you something?
Mayuri|What are we doing here?
Rintaro|Wait. You followed me here without knowing why?
Mayuri|Yup.
Rintaro|We’re here for Doctor Nakabachi’s press conference.
Mayuri|Press conference? But where are the reporters?
Rintaro|Could this be the Organization working its twisted influence?
Rintaro|I’d prefer not to get wrapped up in his mess.
Mayuri|You wrapped something? Is it his birthday too? Ehehe!
Rintaro|Keep your guard up, Mayuri. I suspect this won’t be a normal confer--
Mayuri|An earthquake? Is it magnitude 2? What does magnitude mean again?
Rintaro|An explosion!?
Rintaro|What the...
Woman|Please stay back, everybody!
Woman|The press conference will proceed as scheduled!
Rintaro|I’ve got a nose for conspiracies, and this stinks of a coverup. What are they hiding? What was that explosion?
Rintaro|It’s me. I’ve got a bad feeling about this. Something’s happening, and I have no idea what it is.
Rintaro|...Yeah, I know. Don’t worry. I won’t do anything to jeopardize the mission. El Psy Kongroo.
Rintaro|What are you doing?
Mayuri|Hmm?
Mayuri|Well... I really want an Upa.
Rintaro|Then go for it. I can’t guarantee you’ll get an Upa, though.
Mayuri|But Mayushii’s all out of 100-yen coins.
Mayuri|So, can I borrow 100 yen? Please?
Rintaro|Do you think it’s that easy, Mayuri? You’ll get no money from me. Instead, I’ll show you just how harsh life really is.
Mayuri|Ah, ahh...
Mayuri|It’s an Upa! And it’s metal! A Metal Upa!
Rintaro|Is it rare?
Mayuri|Super rare!
Boy|Aw, a normal Upa...
Rintaro|Hmph. I give this creature of metal to you, Mayuri.
Mayuri|Really!? Are you sure, Okarin?
Rintaro|The name’s Hououin Kyouma!
Mayuri|Ehehe! Thank you, Okarin.
Rintaro|...
Presenter|Thank you all for coming to Doctor Nakabachi’s Time Machine Press Conference.
Rintaro|Sounds like they’re starting.
Rintaro|Let’s go, Mayuri.
Mayuri|Mm... just a sec. I gotta write my name.
Presenter|Without further ado, I am pleased to introduce the inventor, Doctor Nakabachi! Please welcome him with a big round of applause!
Nakabachi|I am Doctor Nakabachi. Thank you all for coming.
Nakabachi|Now then, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin with my theory of time travel, the greatest scientific breakthrough of the century.
Mayuri|Did he really build a time machine?
Rintaro|DOOOOOCTOOOOOOOORRR!!
Rintaro|Do you take us for fools!?
Nakabachi|Who the hell are you?
Rintaro|Who the hell am I!? Someone who knows you for a fraud, that’s who!
Rintaro|You stole your theory from John Titor! And you call yourself an inventor!?
Nakabachi|S-someone throw this man out!
Rintaro|You’re the one we should throw out, Doctor! Have you no shame!? You have no right to call yourself an inventor!
Nakabachi|Shut your mouth, you little pest!
Rintaro|Unhand me, you... huh?
???|...
Rintaro|Ah...
Kurisu|Could you come with me for a moment?
Rintaro|Y-you’re with the Organization!?
Kurisu|Huh?
Rintaro|If their tendrils have gotten this far, then I’ve made a grave mistake.
Kurisu|Stop fooling around and come with me.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Try anything and people are sure to notice. What will your superiors say then?
Kurisu|What are you talking about?
Kurisu|I just need to ask you something.
Rintaro|What makes you think I’ll answer? I know how the Organization operates.
Kurisu|What’s with this ’Organization’ stuff?
Rintaro|It’s me. I’ve been caught by an Organization agent. ...Yes, it’s Makise Kurisu. She’s a dangerous one. ...No, it’s fine. I’ll find a way to--
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|What are you doing!?
Kurisu|Huh? Your phone’s off.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...Who were you talking to?
Rintaro|Y-your techniques don’t work on me, but I’ll tell you anyway. That’s no ordinary phone. It’s designed to deactivate the moment it leaves my hand. Muhahaha!
Kurisu|...So you talk to yourself.
Rintaro|Guh!
Kurisu|What were you trying to tell me earlier?
Rintaro|What are you talking about?
Kurisu|About fifteen minutes ago. Before the conference started.
Kurisu|You were trying to tell me something, right? You looked really upset.
Kurisu|You looked like you were going to start crying any second.
Kurisu|Why? Have we met before?
Kurisu|And how do you know my name?
Rintaro|My knowledge has no limits.
Rintaro|Genius girl, our next meeting shall be as enemies!
Kurisu|Huh?
Rintaro|Farewell! Muhahaha!
Rintaro|Damn the Organization! They must be serious if they’re sending in agents like her!
Rintaro|But I can’t let them capture me yet.
Rintaro|...Damn. I left Mayuri behind.
Rintaro|Hm? An email?
Rintaro|...Hm?
Rintaro|Dammit, Mayuri. Why won’t you pick up?
Rintaro|Wait, don’t tell me! Did that femme fatale kidnap Mayuri!?
Rintaro|Damn you! Is that how the Organization operates!?
Rintaro|I have to go back for her.
Rintaro|Heh, looks like I scared her off.
Rintaro|So be it. I’ll let her go this time.
Rintaro|Mayuri! Why didn’t you pick up? We’re leaving.
Mayuri|Okarin! My Metal Upa ran away.
Rintaro|Ran away? What, it’s alive? That’s a little hard to believe.
Mayuri|I think I dropped it...
Rintaro|Forget about it. You can always get another one.
Mayuri|No way. Metal Upas sell upwards of 10,000 yen online, you know?
Rintaro|Wait... what?
Rintaro|Think, Mayuri! Where did you drop it!?
Mayuri|I don’t know! That’s why I’m looking. And even if we find it, you can’t sell it, okay?
Rintaro|Muhahaha! That 10,000 yen will fund my research!
Mayuri|I said you can’t sell it! It even has Mayushii’s name on it.
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Upa, Upa, come out, come out, wherever you are!
Rintaro|What kind of man steals a helpless girl’s toy? Is there nothing in his heart but the lust for money!?
Mayuri|Sounds like you, Okarin!
???|AHHHHHHHHHHH!
Rintaro|!?
Mayuri|Was that a scream?
Rintaro|Stay here, Mayuri!
Rintaro|Wha...
Rintaro|No... but... why?
Presenter|Uwahhh!
Presenter|Call the police!
Mayuri|What happened, Okarin?
Rintaro|W-we’re leaving!
Rintaro|Haah, haah...
Mayuri|Hey, what happened? You look really pale...
Rintaro|Someone... died.
Mayuri|Eh...
Rintaro|Wha!?
Rintaro|They’re gone...
Rintaro|Hey, you. Can you see us?
Rintaro|Why won’t you answer? I’m asking you a question. Yes, you on the other side of the monitor.
Rintaro|Hmph. Your silence only strengthens my hypothesis.
Rintaro|I suppose that, from your perspective, it appears that we are the ones inside the monitor. Heh heh heh, but that’s where you’re wrong!
Rintaro|For it is you who are inside! Your reality is nothing but lies and shadows. Naturally, that includes you, too.
Rintaro|True reality is on this side of the screen.
Rintaro|Don’t believe me? I don’t blame you. Few are those who can handle the truth.
Rintaro|But no matter. I shall speak in simpler terms, easy enough for even you to understand.
Rintaro|This is the Future Gadget Laboratory, located in the Akihabara district of Tokyo. We call it simply... the lab. Our purpose is to shatter the System and plunge the world into chaos.
Mayuri|Really? You shouldn’t do bad things, Okarin.
Rintaro|Quiet. I’m a mad scientist, remember?
Rintaro|From the station, head down Chuo-dori until you reach Suehirocho Station, then take a left onto Kuramaebashi-dori. In the alley before the traffic light, you’ll find the run-down Ohiyama Building. The lab is on the second floor.
Rintaro|On the first floor is a store of ill repute called the Braun Tube Workshop. You can’t miss it.
Rintaro|It deals exclusively in CRT monitors, of all things. Can you imagine? Even in the heart of Akihabara’s Electric Town, the demand for CRTs is practically nonexistent.
Rintaro|But the proprietor of the Braun Tube Workshop, Tennouji, is also the owner of the building.
Rintaro|That’s how he can afford to maintain his ridiculously niche hobby shop even as land value continues to rise.
Rintaro|He may seem a rough sort, but he was no match for my charisma. Now the entire second floor is mine for next to nothing. Muhahaha!
Rintaro|I digress. The Future Gadget Laboratory is currently experiencing a severe shortage of manpower. We welcome dedicated scientists from all fields to apply. At present, our researchers are--
Mayuri|Okarin, Okarin. You’ve gotta say ’lab mems’, not researchers.
Rintaro|...Our lab mems -- laboratory members -- are three!
Rintaro|I am the founder of the Future Gadget Lab, Lab Mem Number 001, the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!
Mayuri|’Okarin’ is cuter, though...
Rintaro|Next, we have our resident cosplayer and only female member, Lab Mem Number 002, Shiina Mayuri.
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Call me Mayushii! I like making costumes more than wearing them.
Rintaro|And last, we have our resident super hacka, Lab Mem Number 003, Hashida Itaru.
Itaru|Stop calling me that! It’s super hacker, duh.
Rintaro|Here at the Future Gadget Laboratory, we devote ourselves to the art of invention!
Rintaro|For details, see our lab’s homepage.
Rintaro|Our top priority, of course, is to develop weapons for the war with the Dark Dominion, but that research has spawned a number of offshoot inventions. In fact, that’s all it’s spawned.
Rintaro|Our arsenal of Future Gadgets is up to eight, but this is just the beginning. I have a total of 108 inventions to create!
Itaru|Like in that tennis manga, right? I get it.
Rintaro|No! It’s the number of earthly desires in mortals, you @channel junkie.
Rintaro|And I thought I told you not interrupt me when I’m talking!
Itaru|Yeah, wouldn’t want to interrupt you talking to yourself.
Rintaro|I’m not talking to myself. Can’t you see? I’m talking to the person behind the monitor.
Mayuri|Ah, he just grinned!
Rintaro|What are you grinning about, damn you!? You don’t even exist outside that monitor!
Itaru|Just say ’don’t look at me’.
Mayuri|I don’t think that’s gonna work...
Rintaro|It appears our attempts to communicate have failed. It’s sad to see someone so deeply in denial of reality.
Mayuri|Maybe they think we’re in the game?
Itaru|I doubt it’s even occurred to them.
Mayuri|But aren’t your 2D girlfriends the same way?
Itaru|That’s different. Those girls are my wives.
Rintaro|Nobody cares about your harem.
Itaru|But Mayushii touched upon a very interesting theme, ya know? What if we’re actually just characters in a game? Any way we can know for sure?
Rintaro|No.
Itaru|Come on!
Rintaro|Such questions are meaningless. Our time is better spent thinking of ways to destroy the System.
Itaru|Nice chuunibyou, bro.
Rintaro|Shut it, hacka. I’m no chuunibyou patient.
Rintaro|I am Hououin... Kyouma!
Itaru|That’s your character’s name, right?
Rintaro|Oh Daru... your communication skills are beyond repair.
Itaru|I’ll have you know I go to a ton of offline meets, and I’m always the life of the party.
Mayuri|Ow... the needle bit my finger...
Mayuri|Mayushii is Okarin’s hostage! I belong here!
Itaru|So, did Alpacaman say anything?
Rintaro|Nope. Nothing.
Rintaro|Damn antisocial alpaca!
Rintaro|Hm?
Mayuri|You made Mr.Alpaca angry!
Rintaro|Damn. I’ll have to get it repaired later.
Rintaro|They’re gone...
Mayuri|What’s wrong?
Rintaro|E-everyone disappeared just now, right!?
Mayuri|Huh?
Rintaro|You saw it too, right!? Just now, before our very eyes!
Rintaro|Did you see it, Mayuri!? You saw it, right!?
Mayuri|Hmmm? Huhhhhh?
Mayuri|IIIII diiiiidn’t seeeee anythiiiiing!
Rintaro|You... didn’t?
Rintaro|You saw nothing? Nothing at all!? There were people here a second ago, weren’t there!?
Mayuri|...There were?
Rintaro|Even the store employees are gone! That’s impossible by any measure!
Mayuri|Of course they are...
Mayuri|It was like this when we got here. Oh, I know! You’re seeing things, aren’t you?
Mayuri|I’m sure it’s ’cause of the heat! Tutturu♪
Rintaro|...What the hell is that satellite doing there?
Rintaro|Mayuri, about that satellite...
Mayuri|Yup. What a surprise, huh?
Rintaro|What do you mean? What was a surprise?
Mayuri|It made a huge ’kaplow’ sound!
Rintaro|Did that satellite fall out of the sky?
Mayuri|Did it? Do you think any aliens were on board?
Rintaro|...
Policeman|Hey! You two!
Policeman|What do you think you’re doing here? This area is off-limits. You have to leave.
Mayuri|We’re sorry!
Rintaro|First, my good man -- let’s call you ’Officer A’ -- I have one question!
Officer A|Officer A...?
Rintaro|Thousands of people just vanished! You saw it too, didn’t you!?
Officer A|What are you talking about? Get out of here!
Officer A|Look, I don’t have time for your nonsense.
Rintaro|I see... so that’s it!
Rintaro|This is all an elaborate coverup by the Organization! Their influence has corrupted local law enforcement, which means our entire government may already be under their control. My god!
Rintaro|But they underestimated me, for I am not so easily played. One day, I will expose their deeds and put an end to their reign!
Rintaro|Ah, elixir intellectualis, a drink fit for a genius!
Itaru|Cola’s better.
Mayuri|Okarin really loves his Dr P!
Rintaro|I pity the man who knows not the greatness of this beverage! Muhahaha!
Rintaro|Daru. Is the plan progressing smoothly?
Itaru|Uh, what plan?
Rintaro|The plan, as in the plan. Obviously, I’m talking about perfecting Gadget No. 8.
Itaru|Oh, that. How was I supposed to know what you meant?
Rintaro|We’ve known each other for what, three years now?
Itaru|We were in different classes junior year, and actually we didn’t talk at all. So two years?
Rintaro|Details. The point is we’ve known each other a long time. I expect you to keep up with me here.
Itaru|N O P E
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|So, are we any closer to figuring out what’s wrong with Gadget No. 8?
Itaru|Not yet.
Itaru|We tried copying what Mayu-shi did, but we just can’t reproduce the freezing phenomenon.
Itaru|And when we tried to freeze a banana, it turned out really weird.
Itaru|I just don’t get it.
Rintaro|Mayuri! Mayuri! Bring forth the bananas!
Mayuri|Are you gonna turn them into gelbanas again?
Itaru|That’s been bugging me, Mayu-shi. Can you stop calling them ’gelbanas’?
Mayuri|But gelbanas are gelbanas.
Mayuri|Why do you have to use the whole bunch? It’s a waste of food.
Rintaro|Your stinginess could cost us the battle with the Organization!
Mayuri|That’s fine with me. Mayushii always buys the bananas, and now Mayushii can’t eat a single one.
Rintaro|Next time, we’ll only do one banana.
Guidance|Hello. This is the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Mayuri|Do you hear Mayushii’s voice?
Rintaro|Be quiet. I’m trying to listen.
Guidance|You can operate the timer from this menu.
Guidance|After pushing the # button, please enter the heating time in seconds.
Guidance|For example, press ’#60’ for one minute.
Guidance|For two minutes, press ’#120’.
Itaru|Won’t this just warm it normally?
Itaru|Nice turntable, right? It’s even spinning backwards.
Rintaro|Backwards!?
Rintaro|That might have serious implications! If we look at quantum critical behavior driven by Hund’s rule--
Itaru|Yeah! No.
Rintaro|...not Hund’s Rule?
Itaru|No.
Rintaro|...okay.
Mayuri|Gelbanas are ready!
Rintaro|Daru. You wouldn’t mind eating one of these, would you? Of course you wouldn’t. It’s for science! Your sacrifice will forever be remembered!
Itaru|...They look really nasty.
Rintaro|The taste doesn’t matter. What matters is that you eat it! So come on, Daru, no need to be shy. Break a leg, or a stomach, and go for it!
Itaru|No way.
Rintaro|...Fine. Mayuri! The honor shall be yours.
Mayuri|But gelbanas are all gloopy, droopy, soft, and squishy.
Mayuri|It had no flavor and wasn’t tasty at all...
Rintaro|Gloopy, droopy, soft and squishy... Daru, what do you think?
Itaru|Soft and squishy bananas, huh... Soft and squishy... banana...
Itaru|Mayu-shi, say ’your banana’s all soft and squishy’ for me.
Mayuri|Daru-kun, your nose is bleeding.
Itaru|Please just say it!
Mayuri|Your banana’s all soft and--
Rintaro|Don’t make her say that, you perv!
Rintaro|They’re gelatinous, a semi-solid state of matter. In other words, there is a possibility that the intermolecular bonds were weakened.
Rintaro|I’ve got it!
Rintaro|What we thought was a freezing function is actually something else!
Rintaro|Now’s the time to shout, ’W-what you say!?’ Come on, don’t be shy!
Itaru|Uh, we already knew that.
Itaru|The problem is we don’t know what it is doing, or why it’s doing it.
Mayuri|If it’s the opposite of freezing, then couldn’t it be thawing them?
Rintaro|What a silly question, Mayuri. What you’re describing is just a normal microwave!
Mayuri|Then, what is it?
Itaru|We don’t know, and that’s the problem.
Rintaro|...
Female Reporter|Behind me is the large, unidentified object that crashed into a building near Akihabara Station!
Female Reporter|The building is under police barricade. No one is allowed to approach, but from a distance, the object appears to be some kind of satellite!
Rintaro|Daru, aren’t you going to check out Radi-Kan?
Itaru|No point. Can’t get close. I’ve been following the news online, though. There’s already a hundred threads about it on @channel. It’s huge, man.
Itaru|Man, feel that AC! I’m alive!
Rintaro|About the PhoneWave (name subject to change). I might have found our answer.
Itaru|You know, that ’(name subject to change)’ thing is really annoying.
Rintaro|Now’s not the time.
Itaru|So, what’s your latest ridiculous theory?
Rintaro|What do you mean, ridiculous? My genius brain considers every possibility, even those a lesser mind would say break the laws of nature. Don’t you dare call that ridiculous.
Itaru|So basically, you’re just pulling stuff outta your ass. You can’t call that science.
Rintaro|Daru. I have a hunch that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) may be the key to opening Steins Gate. How’s that?
Itaru|Steins what? You lost me back at ’ridiculous’, man.
???|Ah!
???|I’m sorry!
Rintaro|Wha...!?
Rintaro|You... you...!
Kurisu|Is there something wrong?
Kurisu|O-ow!
Rintaro|Y-you...
Rintaro|You should be dead! Why are you here!?
Rintaro|And you’re even...
Rintaro|Not a scratch...
Kurisu|Hey, that hurts! Let me go!
Kurisu|What’s wrong with you?
Rintaro|You’re okay? But that’s impossible! Someone stabbed you! I saw you lying in a pool of blood!
Itaru|That again?
Rintaro|What do you mean, ’again’?
Itaru|I mean, you sent me that email like a week ago, right?
Rintaro|I sent you an email?
Rintaro|Don’t be ridiculous! I saw her dead just three hours ago!
Kurisu|Hey! Could you not talk about me like that? I’m perfectly fine.
Itaru|You know, that message was kinda weird. It was dated a week after I got it, which means it came from the future.
Kurisu|It came from the future?
Rintaro|That sounds like something you’d read on the internet, Daru. It’s rare for you to talk about ridiculous theories.
Itaru|No, the date was definitely a week later. It came from, uh... the 28th. Wait. That’s today!
Rintaro|This is the email I sent you three hours ago.
Kurisu|Interesting...
Rintaro|Substance. She has substance. Of course she’s not a ghost. How silly of me.
Kurisu|...
Itaru|O-Okarin, I don’t think that’s a good idea...
Kurisu|...Hey.
Kurisu|Are you trying to get yourself arrested?
Rintaro|I just want to know the truth.
Kurisu|What truth, you perv!? You stupid!? Wanna die!?
Itaru|Louise-chan’s famous line for the win!
Rintaro|I know what I saw!
Kurisu|No way! Did you just see my underw...!?
Rintaro|No, you fool! Not that!
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|Wait. Doctor Nakabachi?
Itaru|What are you talking about, Okarin? Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation was canceled.
Rintaro|Canceled!?
Itaru|Yeah. Because of the satellite crash.
Kurisu|Excuse me, um...
Rintaro|My name... is Hououin Kyouma!
Itaru|Really, man? You’re hopeless...
Kurisu|Okay, Hououin-san. I’d like to hear your story in more detail.
Professor|Makise-san? It’s almost time.
Kurisu|Huh? Oh, right. Thank you.
Itaru|We should go too.
Rintaro|Go where?
Itaru|To hear the lecture, duh?
Kurisu|Um, I’d like to thank everyone for coming to hear me speak today.
Rintaro|She’s the one giving the lecture...
Kurisu|It’s my first time giving a lecture like this, so please forgive me if I’m a little nervous.
Kurisu|For today’s lecture, I’ve been asked to speak on the subject of time travel. It’s not really my area of expertise, but I’ll try my best.
Rintaro|Time travel? Oh-ho...
Kurisu|Let me start by saying that time travel is an absurd concept.
Rintaro|OBJECTION!
Kurisu|Hwa...!?
Rintaro|It’s presumptuous for you to claim that time travel is absurd!
Itaru|Okarin, you magnificent fool!
Kurisu|Um... okay. It’s fine, I guess. It’ll be easier to talk in a discussion format.
Kurisu|But before that, please listen to my thoughts on the subject.
Kurisu|Scientists have proposed many theoretical models of time travel, but there are eleven in particular that bear mentioning.
Kurisu|Neutron Star Theory. Black Hole Theory. Lightspeed Theory.
Kurisu|Tachyon Theory. Wormhole Theory. Exotic Matter Theory.
Kurisu|Cosmic String Theory. Quantum Gravity Theory. Cesium Laser Theory.
Kurisu|Elementary Particle Ring & Laser Theory. Dirac Antiparticle Theory.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|However, all of these models are purely theoretical.
Kurisu|Some of them even contradict each other.
Rintaro|Well, what if someone comes up with a 12th model?
Kurisu|Hm? Ahh, uhh, right, well...
Kurisu|It could be contradicted by the 13th model, now couldn’t it?
Kurisu|By the way, time travel to the future is available to us right now, according to Einstein’s special theory of relativity.
Kurisu|For example, let’s say someone were to go to Haneda Airport and board a plane headed to Okinawa. Upon arrival, that person would be about one hundred millionth of a second farther into the future than I am.
Kurisu|According to the special theory of relativity, time moves slower for objects as they approach the speed of light.
Kurisu|For example, if you could run at near the speed of light, you could reach a point where time only moves half as fast for you.
Kurisu|If you were to keep running at that speed for 24 hours, 48 hours would elapse in the rest of the world, meaning you would ’jump’ one day into the future. Understand, Hououin Kyouma?
Rintaro|Gah!
Professor|But that’s not really time travel, is it?
Kurisu|Yes, you’re right.
Professor|Then what about going to the past?
Kurisu|Going to the past is possible right now. Take a look at the sky at night. You can see light from tens of thousands of years ago, can’t you?
Student|That’s not time travel either!
Kurisu|Well, I was just getting started.
Kurisu|Let’s say we wanted to make a machine that could physically transport people through time. What would we need?
Kurisu|The best candidates for this are cosmic strings and wormholes.
Kurisu|A cosmic string is a string-shaped ’crevice’ with extreme mass.
Kurisu|The crevice is about as wide as an elementary particle, and at least as long as the diameter of a galaxy.
Kurisu|It has immense mass, so it distorts space-time. If you were to travel through that distortion, you could make a full circle around the string in less than 360 degrees.
Kurisu|In short, you can do something resembling a warp. This is called a space-time angular deficit.
Kurisu|When you pass through an area of angular deficit, transit time becomes zero.
Kurisu|Now we apply this to a cosmic string moving at near-light speed.
Kurisu|According to the special theory of relativity, time will flow slower for the cosmic string in relation to its surroundings.
Kurisu|Therefore, passing through the area of angular deficit would cause the transit time to become negative instead of zero.
Kurisu|In other words, you will arrive in the past after transit.
Kurisu|If you use two cosmic strings, you can do a space deficit jump. If you loop back to your original location, you can return to the same time you started revolving.
Kurisu|And that, roughly speaking, is time travel by means of cosmic strings.
Kurisu|By the way, just so nobody misunderstands, cosmic strings are not the same as superstrings.
Kurisu|Now then, you need three things in order to travel to the past with cosmic strings.
Kurisu|First. The cosmic strings themselves. Two strings, to be exact. By the way, they are hypothesized to exist only where the universe was first formed, so they might be a little hard to find.
Kurisu|Second. You would need the energy required to make them move them at near-light speed.
Kurisu|How much energy do you think you’d need to accelerate something as long as the Milky Way to near the speed of light? I’m pretty sure it’s a little more than 1.21 jigowatts.
Kurisu|Third. You’d need a spaceship capable of reaching these cosmic strings and returning. With the time traveler alive, of course.
Kurisu|What do you think, Hououin-san? Care to take on the challenge of cosmic string time travel?
Kurisu|Hm? Looks like Hououin-san doesn’t want to take the challenge.
Kurisu|In that case, let’s consider wormholes. They may be a little more realistic than cosmic strings.
Kurisu|By the way, Hououin-san. Do you know what wormholes are?
Rintaro|It’s like a shortcut through space... right?
Kurisu|Yes, that’s correct.
Kurisu|There are two wormholes joined by a tunnel. No matter how far away the wormholes are, transit time through the tunnel is zero.
Kurisu|But oh no, there’s a problem. The wormhole tunnel suffers from super gravity, and collapses as soon as it opens.
Kurisu|So we need something to negate the effect of gravity.
Kurisu|So-called ’exotic matter’. A substance with negative mass which repulses other matter.
Kurisu|Say that the wormhole tunnel is being squished by an invisible fist.
Kurisu|In order to pass through, you need something that could oppose my fist’s ’grasping force’ so that I can’t squish anymore. 
Kurisu|If you stabilize the tunnel with exotic matter injection, instantaneous travel between wormholes becomes possible. To travel through time, however, takes a little more effort.
Kurisu|For example, let’s say there’s a wormhole entrance here in Akihabara, and the exit is in Los Angeles.
Kurisu|First, we send the wormhole in LA all the way to the end of the universe at near the speed of light. And once it’s there, we yank it back to LA.
Kurisu|According to the special theory of relativity, time slows down for objects moving at the speed of light. Meaning the hole that returned to LA would be further in the past than the Akihabara hole.
Kurisu|So now, if Hououin-san jumped into the wormhole, he’d arrive in LA several years before he left.
Kurisu|However, this still can’t be called true time travel. It only seems that way. This is called the Urashima effect.
Kurisu|The important part is to return to Akihabara from LA through the wormhole once more. Since the transit time is zero...
Kurisu|Hououin-san will return to Akihabara several years in the past. Time travel complete.
Kurisu|The prerequisites for wormhole travel are simpler than the ones for cosmic string travel.
Kurisu|First. The wormhole itself. They may exist somewhere in the universe. But nobody has ever seen one.
Kurisu|Second. The energy required to move a wormhole to the end of the universe and back at near-light speed.
Kurisu|Third. Exotic matter, which, by the way, has not been confirmed to exist.
Kurisu|Now do you see what I meant when I said that time travel is an absurd concept?
Kurisu|Time travel theories are all just thought experiments. Not one of them can create a viable time machine. That is my answer.
Student|Isn’t there anything simpler? Like something you can pull out of a drawer and just use, or something.
Kurisu|I’m afraid not.
Kurisu|This is the limit of modern physics. I can’t say how it might change in ten years, though.
Kurisu|Besides, even if someone did overcome the logistical requirements, there may be other factors that prevent time travel from working.
Kurisu|And that’s because fundamental problems concerning the principle of causality have not yet been solved.
Rintaro|You mean time paradoxes... and conservation of mass?
Kurisu|If you think that conservation of mass applies to macro-systems like the universe or micro-systems like atoms or elementary particles, you’re mistaken.
Kurisu|Heh.
Kurisu|Conservation of mass only applies to chemical reactions. It doesn’t hold in modern physics at all.
Kurisu|Something can come from nothing.
Professor|Then what is the problem?
Kurisu|The time paradox of time paradoxes. In other words, the Grandfather Paradox.
Kurisu|As long as this paradox goes unsolved, time travel can never be realized. Never.
Student|What if you just don’t kill them?
Kurisu|You can’t think of it like a sci-fi movie. It’s not just about your family tree. There are far greater dangers than that.
Kurisu|Any paradox, no matter how small, would cause the total collapse of causality, relativity, and every other physical law in existence.
Kurisu|Paradoxes are nothing more than thought experiments. They cannot occur in reality, and they should not.
Kurisu|Nothing that has even a 0.000001% chance of causing a paradox can happen. The universe won’t allow it. Wouldn’t you say this is the logical conclusion?
Kurisu|There may be loopholes, like parallel worlds or the self-consistency principle, but those seem too much like fantasy for me to accept.
Rintaro|Gah...
Mayuri|It’s Okarin! Tutturu♪
Luka|Good afternoon, Okabe-san.
Rintaro|Lukako. That blade I gave you, what happened to it?
Luka|Um, you mean... Demon Sword Samidare?
Rintaro|Correct. I bought it for you so you could learn to control your power.
Mayuri|Oh yeah! You bought it at BladeWorks, right? I think you said it cost 980--
Rintaro|Don’t say another word! Any more and they will come to silence you!
Mayuri|They’re gonna silence me? Thanks for worrying about me, Okarin. But who are they?
Rintaro|So, Lukako. Are you making sure to practice with Samidare like I told you?
Luka|Y-yes, I do practice swings once a day...
Rintaro|As long as you carry it and master the Seishin Zanma school of swordsmanship, you can prevent the dark flame inside you from consuming your soul.
Luka|Thank you, Okabe-san. It was a wonderful present.
Rintaro|My name isn’t Okabe.
Mayuri|It’s Okarin!
Luka|I’m sorry, Kyouma-san.
Rintaro|As long as you understand. Now, speak the words.
Luka|Ah, umm. El... Psy... Kongaloo...?
Rintaro|No! Not Kongaloo! Kongroo!
Luka|Y-yes!
Luka|El... Psy... Kongroo.
Luka|D-did I get it right?
Luka|Thank you.
Mayuri|Such a beautiful master-disciple relationship. Mayushii’s not a fujoshi, but she’s getting a little excited.
Luka|Ehh!? M-Mayuri-chan, please don’t imagine such things...
Rintaro|What are you doing here, Mayuri?
Mayuri|I came to see Luka-kun.
Mayuri|ComiMa’s coming up next month, and I want him to cosplay as Kirari-chan from RaiNet. But he won’t say yes...
Luka|But, cosplaying... that’s just too embarrassing for me...
Mayuri|But I’m sure you’ll look great in it!
Mayuri|The phrase ’someone this cute can’t be a girl’ is really popular, you know? C’mon, make your cosplay debut!
Rintaro|Save the trivial stuff for later.
Mayuri|Ehh? But it’s really important to Mayushii.
Rintaro|And it’s trivial to me!
Rintaro|Anyway, Lukako. There’s a good reason for my being here today. I need you to perform an exorcism.
Luka|An exorcism? Then I’ll go get my dad. Please wa--
Rintaro|No, it’s nothing that serious. I just need some peace of mind.
Rintaro|So with that said, bring out the usual.
Luka|Um, the usual? You mean Samidare?
Rintaro|No! Who the hell uses a demon sword for an exorcism!? The usual for an exorcism should be obvious!
Luka|Uhh... um...?
Rintaro|I don’t know what it’s called, but it’s that stick with the zigzaggy paper thingies that the priest does a shaky thingy with!
Mayuri|Ahaha! That sounded really dumb, Okarin!
Luka|Oh, the oonusa. But, I don’t know if my father will lend it to me...
Luka|I’ll go ask him.
Mayuri|Well, time for me to go to work!
Rintaro|Do your best. You going straight home afterwards?
Mayuri|Yup.
Mayuri|See you tomorrow!
Rintaro|Wait, Mayuri. Back at Radi-Kan, you heard a man scream, right?
Mayuri|Scream?
Mayuri|When was that again?
Rintaro|This afternoon.
Mayuri|I don’t think I heard anything...
Rintaro|...Oh. Well, alright.
Mayuri|Okarin’s a weirdo!
Mayuri|Bye bye! Tutturu♪
Luka|Thanks for waiting, Okabe-san.
Luka|Dad let me borrow it. Thank goodness.
Luka|Um, did Mayuri-chan leave?
Rintaro|Don’t worry about Mayuri. Begin the exorcism at once, Lukako!
Luka|Um, okay, but do you really want me to do it? What exactly am I exorcising, anyway?
Rintaro|Guh! It’s the evil spirit... in my arm!
Rintaro|Be still, foul spirit! Guh... Hurry, Lukako! It’s trying to take over!
Luka|N-no way! Please hang in there, Okabe-san!
Rintaro|I’m not Okabe-san!
Luka|I’m sorry, Kyouma-san! Ahh, but what should I...
Rintaro|The exorcism... hurry! Just do it... like I taught you!
Luka|O-okay!
Luka|Ummm... ummm...
Rintaro|Please... Luka... expel... this spirit... from me...
Rintaro|I don’t... want to... kill you!
Luka|Uuh...
Luka|H-hear me, evil spirit!
Luka|Please leave from Okabe -- I mean Kyouma-san!
Rintaro|That’s great! Now strike my arm with those zigzags!
Luka|Ei!!
Luka|D-did it work?
Rintaro|...I’m okay. Looks like you drove away the evil spirit. Good job, Lukako.
Luka|I’m glad I was able to help.
???|Yo! What’s up, Okabe?
Rintaro|What’s up? That TV you gave me broke, that’s what.
Tennouji|I bet you were treating it rough, weren’t ya?
Tennouji|Love. You gotta’ treat ’em with love!
Rintaro|I’ll need repairs post-haste.
Tennouji|Man, why do you always talk like that?
Rintaro|You’re open late today. Don’t you usually close around seven?
Tennouji|I’m expecting someone.
Rintaro|You mean that chipmunk of yours?
Tennouji|Don’t be calling my little girl a chipmunk, you hear?
Tennouji|If you touch Nae, you’re dead.
Rintaro|But seriously, besides your daughter, has this workshop ever had a customer?
Tennouji|Ain’t a customer.
Tennouji|Hmm, there’s probably just a loose solder on the board. I can fix it.
Rintaro|Really? Well, then by all means.
Tennouji|Hold on. I’ll get you an estimate.
Rintaro|What!? You’re charging me!?
Tennouji|What’d you think? This ain’t some charity!
Rintaro|You’re the one who gave us the TV!
Tennouji|Yeah, so what? Never said I’d service it for free.
Rintaro|Curse you... you have some gall to say that after foisting a half-broken piece of junk onto us!
Tennouji|Oh, shut up. If you don’t want it, I can take it back. Though I’ll have to charge ya for its safe disposal.
Rintaro|Extortion! You dare cheat the man who very well may change the future of mankind!?
Tennouji|Hah? Who’s that, now?
Rintaro|Me, of course. Who else?
Tennouji|Brush your teeth and go to sleep, kid. You’ve got some nerve to be back-talking when I’m lettin’ you rent the second floor for next to nothing.
Rintaro|Hmph. You shall have your money, Mister Braun.
???|Wazzaaap!
Rintaro|...
Tennouji|...
???|Um...?
Amane|Um, I called earlier. I’m Amane.
Tennouji|Oh, so you’re the kid for the job interview. I’m Tennouji, the manager.
Rintaro|A job interview!? This young woman!?
Rintaro|You want to work at the dull, dirty, depressing, debt-ridden Braun Tube Workshop with this filthy old manager?
Tennouji|You want an extra thousand yen added to your rent?
Rintaro|...My words are but the truth. Though I suppose it’s not my place to get involved.
Rintaro|Anyway, I had no idea the Braun Tube Workshop was hiring. You always look so... free. I didn’t know you needed the help.
Amane|Actually, I’m the one who begged for the job.
Amane|The boss refused at first, but I wouldn’t take no for an answer.
Tennouji|Kids with drive are rare these days. Take a seat right there, young lady.
Amane|Oh, thank you.
Tennouji|Right. What was your name again?
Amane|Amane Suzuha.
Tennouji|Age?
Amane|18.
Tennouji|Student?
Amane|No.
Tennouji|Why do you want to work here?
Suzuha|Because I love CRTs.
Tennouji|Hired! You start tomorrow!
Rintaro|Wait, what? Is this some sort of joke? Are we on camera!?
Suzuha|Thanks, boss.
Suzuha|Um, who are you?
Rintaro|You... dare ask my name? Banish the thought from your head, girl. To learn it would place your life in jeopardy.
Rintaro|Countless women have learned my name only to find themselves targets of the Organization. Sarah in America, Claudia in Italy, Simone in France... I won’t put anyone else in danger.
Tennouji|Hey, stop pulling things outta yer ass.
Tennouji|This idiot rents the second floor. Name’s Okabe Rintaro.
Rintaro|My name is not Okabe. It’s Hououin--
Tennouji|Quit it, or I raise your rent.
Rintaro|...I’m Okabe Rintaro.
Suzuha|I don’t know anything about this Organization that’s after you.
Suzuha|But if you’re ever in trouble, Okabe Rintaro, let me know. I can help with stuff like that.
Rintaro|...Huh?
Tennouji|...?
Suzuha|If necessary, I can hurt them so bad they’ll never bother you again.
Rintaro|Mister Braun, I don’t think you should hire her.
Tennouji|Yeah. She might be a wild one. I’ll fire her if she causes any trouble. Anyway, ignore that Organization nonsense. It’s all in Okabe’s head.
Suzuha|It is?
Rintaro|You just keep thinking that.
Suzuha|So that’s the current trend. Thanks for the tip!
Rintaro|...so hot.
Itaru|Yeah?
Rintaro|It’s me. Report.
Itaru|...Okarin, can you drop the act when you’re on the phone at least?
Rintaro|Are you aware that John Titor has returned?
Itaru|I have no idea what you’re talking about.
Rintaro|Where are you, anyway? You coming to the lab?
Itaru|I’m at MayQueen+Nyan².
Rintaro|Again?
Rintaro|I have a sensitive matter to discuss.
Rintaro|Don’t move until I get there.
Itaru|Huh? You’re coming? Fine, bu--
Female Reporter|We’re here now in Akihabara the day after the unexplained satellite crash. The police barricade has been lifted, and a tremendous number of people have gathered in front of the station!
Female Reporter|The satellite’s origin is still under investigation. We’re told that it can’t be removed until the authorities have more information.
Female Reporter|According to the police, the satellite does not appear to be dangerous. However, tourists and local business owners have raised concerns.
Rintaro|...!?
???|...
Rintaro|Wait wait wait!
Lady|...
Rintaro|Hey, you with the phone camera! Wait! Please, wait!
Lady|...?
Rintaro|Hey! No pictures! Are you with the Organization!?
Voyeur Lady|...
Rintaro|Answer my question. Are you with the Organization?
Possible Organization Spy|...
Rintaro|Y-you’re not?
Probably Not Organization Spy|...
Rintaro|Even so, I can’t let you keep that picture. The Organization will stop at nothing to find my whereabouts, and they’ll kill anyone who gets in their way!
Rintaro|I need you to delete that picture immediately.
Lady Ignoring Me|...
Lady Ignoring Me|...Sorry.
Lady Who Apologized out of Nowhere|If I... upset you.
Rintaro|Before you apologize, I need you to delete that photo.
Lady Ignoring Me|I was shooting... the scenery.
Rintaro|The scenery? You’re a tourist?
Lady Ignoring Me and Apparently Sightseeing in Akihabara|...It’s proof. Of where I was today.
Rintaro|You’re a strange lady...
Strange Lady Apparently Sightseeing in Akihabara|Kiryu... Moeka.
Rintaro|Hm?
Moeka|My name.
Moeka|I have a question for you... may I?
Rintaro|First, the photo--
Moeka|There’s an urban legend... in Akihabara.
Moeka|...Have you heard of it?
Rintaro|Gah... I’ve remained in this town for far too long! I’ll need to make plans.
Moeka|The phantom... retro PC.
Rintaro|Retro PC?
Moeka|They say there’s one... in Akihabara.
Rintaro|Oh...
Rintaro|A retro PC... you mean like a 98?
Moeka|...No. This.
Moeka|An IBN 5100.
Rintaro|That’s the computer John Titor tried to get.
Moeka|You’ve seen one?
Rintaro|No. I’ve only heard the name.
Rintaro|This could be the choice of Steins Gate.
Moeka|Know anyone... who might know?
Rintaro|Daru probably knows more about it.
Rintaro|He’s my Favorite Right Arm. A super hacka capable of breaking into even MI6’s mainframe.
Rintaro|Well, I’m off. Lady, media scrum in moderation.
Rintaro|What are you doing!?
Moeka|Your email... please.
Rintaro|...What are you after?
Moeka|The super hacka...
Rintaro|I refuse! I’ll never give up Daru!
Rintaro|...
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Stop following me!
Rintaro|Gehhh! You still haven’t deleted it?
Moeka|Tell me... and I’ll delete it.
Rintaro|You dare blackmail me? Who do you work for?
Moeka|I...
Moeka|Work part-time... at Arc Rewrite.
Rintaro|What’s that?
Moeka|An editorial company... here in Akihabara.
Rintaro|Wait! You plan on publishing my picture without permission, don’t you!?
Rintaro|Very well. I accept your terms.
Rintaro|Of course... this woman is an esper.
Moeka|...Name?
Rintaro|Hououin Kyouma, Mad Scientist.
Moeka|How... is it spelled?
Rintaro|First ’Houou’ for ’phoenix’, then ’in’, and finally ’Kyouma’ which means a ’horrible truth’ that must never be revealed.
Moeka|...Huh?
Rintaro|’Houou’ for ’phoenix’, then ’in’, and finally ’Kyouma’ which means a ’horrible truth’ that must never be revealed.
Moeka|...
Moeka|Like this?
Rintaro|What the hell is this!? Are you mocking me!?
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Just hand me your phone! I’ll enter it!
Moeka|...!
Moeka|...
Rintaro|...
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Woah!
Rintaro|It’s me. What is it?
Itaru|What do you mean, ’what is it’? I’ve been waiting, you know? And what’s with that blank email?
Rintaro|Blank email? It went to you?
Itaru|It sure did.
Rintaro|That was a mistake. Don’t worry. The email will self-destruct in 10 minutes.
Itaru|Hey, just what are--
Moeka|...
Moeka|Okabe... Rintaro?
Rintaro|What!? How do you know that name!?
Moeka|From the blank email...
Rintaro|That’s just my alias. I’ll send another one with my true--
Moeka|No... this is fine.
Rintaro|Nonsense! I am not Okabe Rintaro, but Hououin Kyou--
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Did you delete the picture?
Rintaro|If you deleted it, then prove it.
Moeka|I’ll email you... later.
Moeka|So ask... okay?
Rintaro|About what?
Moeka|...The urban legend.
Moeka|...
Moeka|...
Maids|Welcome back, Myaster!
Mayuri|It’s Okarin!
Mayuri|Welcome back, Okarin.
Mayuri|Hey, Okarin! Mayushii just noticed something.
Mayuri|’Welcome back’ and ’Okarin’ go really well together!
Faris|Kyouma! It’s great that you came, nya!
Faris|Daru-nyan’s here too. He’s been waiting, nya.
Faris|Are you holding another secret meeting to overthrow the evil Organization, nya?
Rintaro|Uh, yeah, something like that.
Faris|Faris wants to join too, nya!
Rintaro|No chance. The Organization isn’t threatened by cat-eared maids.
Faris|Not true, nya. Faris has the purrfect secret technique to help take them down.
Rintaro|What!? You’ve finally mastered that secret technique!?
Faris|Yes, nya... After completing my pilgrimage to the Guiana Highlands and overcoming my mentor’s death, I finally mastered it.
Faris|So Faris wants to participate in the Spirit Conference like you promised, nya!
Rintaro|You’re not suggesting we venture to the Sanctuary!?
Rintaro|The answer is no. Although you may understand the Hidden Secrets, you’re still too inexperienced.
Faris|But... but you promised, nya! Are you going to betray me!?
Faris|My brother is waiting for me there...
Mayuri|Umm, I don’t quite get it, but can Mayushii go to the Sanctuary too?
Rintaro|You can’t come. This discussion is over.
Mayuri|Ehhh?
Faris|No fair, Kyouma!
Mayuri|That’s right! Leaving Mayushii and Feris-chan behind is mean!
Rintaro|...Who’s is ’Feris’?
Mayuri|Feris-chan is Feris-chan. Right?
Faris|Right!
Mayuri|Well, Mayushii has a hard time saying Faris, so I call her Feris-chan instead!
Rintaro|Oh, so that’s it.
Faris|It’s like we’re in a girl’s school. That’s not too... tabby.
Rintaro|Show me to the table already. How long do you want me to stand here waiting?
Faris|Nyahaha! Sorry, nya. Table for two, this way, nyan♪
Faris|Mayushii, I’ll leave it to you, nyan nyan.
Mayuri|Leave it to me, nyan nyan♪
Mayuri|Daru-kun, Okarin is here, nyan.
Itaru|You’re way late. Seriously, man.
Itaru|So, what were you just talking about with Faris? I want details.
Rintaro|...You really want to know? I don’t think you’d understand it.
Itaru|Ah, the usual...
Itaru|Your conversations are too much for regular otaku. You guys exude an aura or something, you know?
Itaru|It’s like you too have your own Reality Marble! You know I can’t forgive you!
Mayuri|I think Feris-chan likes Okarin, nya.
Mayuri|Of all the maids and masters here, nya, the only one who can keep up with Feris-chan is you, Okarin.
Itaru|I’m so jealous! You lucky bastard!
Rintaro|Hmph, I have no interest in women who dress themselves in lies.
Itaru|Like you’re one to talk.
Rintaro|Silence, you unfaithful bastard! All your 2D wives are crying.
Itaru|Gwahh, you struck a nerve, man...
Mayuri|Master, may I take your order, nya?
Rintaro|Omelet rice. And hot coffee. Black.
Mayuri|Coming right up, nyan nyan♪
Itaru|So, what did you need?
Itaru|I was gonna head to the lab in about an hour.
Rintaro|I have an urgent matter to discuss. Top secret.
Rintaro|You remember John Titor?
Itaru|...John Titor? Who’s that?
Rintaro|The self-proclaimed time traveler who appeared on the internet about 10 years ago. I thought we talked about him before.
Itaru|Is this a new addition to your made-up backstory?
Rintaro|It’s nothing like that! Everything I say is the truth!
Itaru|What a pain. Well, I guess I can play along.
Itaru|So, what’s the source on this Titor guy being from the future?
Rintaro|Wait, you’ve seriously never heard about him before?
Itaru|Seriously, bro, I haven’t.
Rintaro|Sure you didn’t just forget?
Itaru|I can’t say for sure.
Rintaro|There are even books about him.
Itaru|I might remember if you show me one.
Rintaro|You really don’t remember?
Itaru|Memories fade. We’re not computers, man.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Then what about the IBN 5100?
Itaru|Woah, you know about that? Cool.
Rintaro|So you know about it?
Itaru|It’s the model IBN released back in 1975.
Rintaro|What kind of computer is it?
Itaru|The stupidly expensive kind.
Itaru|Back when it came out, computers were so expensive that average people couldn’t get their hands on them.
Itaru|It was full of proprietary IBN technology, and was a pretty powerful computer for its time.
Itaru|Then six years later, in 1981, IBN launched the popular IBN PC series. Now that’s more famous.
Itaru|Anyway, it’s not like I’m an expert. This is just stuff I read on a wiki.
Rintaro|Have you heard the urban legend that there’s one in Akiba?
Itaru|You bet I have. Just last month there was big talk about it on the net.
Itaru|Some @channelers heard the rumors and went searching for it. My friend on FrePara, Sister Centipede, was the main person behind that.
Itaru|Even the legendary ’Neidhardt der Blitzschnelle’ joined the fray, but they still couldn’t find it.
Rintaro|So it was just a hoax?
Itaru|Who knows? There are tons of underground shops in Akiba. It wouldn’t be strange if an IBN 5100 suddenly turned up in some hole in the wall.
Rintaro|Hmm. I see.
Rintaro|Sorry for the wait, Daru.
Rintaro|Sorry for the wait, Daru.
Rintaro|So, there’s one thing I need to know.
Rintaro|The IBN 5100 has the power to destroy the world, right?
Itaru|What? It doesn’t have the power to do anything, let alone destroy the damn world.
Faris|What this, nya? The world’s gonna be destroyed, nya?
Faris|Master, thanks for waiting nyan nyan♪ Omelet rice, nyan!
Faris|Please enjoy your meal before the world ends♪
Itaru|Woah, ’The World is Doomed!!’ for the win! Faris’s handwriting is so cute it puts my ’omelet’ in danger too!
Itaru|Ahh... what a waste...
Faris|Daru-nyan, Daru-nyan, have you considered participating in the Faris Cup, nya?
Itaru|Yeah, of course I’m participating!
Rintaro|Faris Cup? What’s that?
Faris|Next Sunday, we’re hosting a RaiNet tournament at the cafe, nya!
Faris|Faris is the event organizer. It’s all my idea, nyan!
Faris|You can participate too if you want, Kyouma! Entrance fee is 1000 yen and includes a drink. Whoever beats Faris gets to enjoy some of Faris’ home-cooking, nya.
Itaru|It’ll never happen. Okarin sucks at RaiNet.
Faris|Nya? But it’s so fun.
Rintaro|No, I’m fine...
Rintaro|RaiNet AccessBattlers, huh... Whenever I hear that name, I remember the former champion... Has it already been two years?
Rintaro|No, it’s nothing. Forget what I said.
Faris|NyaNya? That sounded so serious, nya! Who was the former champion, nya?
Itaru|He probably doesn’t exist. I mean, RaiNet didn’t even have official tournaments until about a year ago.
Rintaro|...
Faris|Kyouma... you still can’t forget him, can you, nya?
Rintaro|What?
Faris|I remember that you and the champion -- my brother -- were such good friends, Kyouma. You were so close it made me jealous, nya.
Faris|But it’s time to let go of the past! Seize the day with your own paws!
Faris|Even though it’s painful... no, because it’s painful, I succeeded my brother’s dying wish and purrfected my skills as a RaiNetter, nya!
Faris|Do you remember, nya? He always used to say, ’Some day, let’s bring peace to the world with RaiNet--’
Rintaro|Faris, bring me my coffee.
Faris|NyaNya?
Faris|Sure thing, Master! Just a moment, nya♪
Itaru|Faris is one of the most skilled Rainetters I know.
Itaru|She’s gone undefeated in over 400 unofficial matches.
Rintaro|Is she Rickson Gracie?
Itaru|It’s so disappointing that Faris doesn’t go to official tournaments. She’d win if she did, no doubt.
Rintaro|Why doesn’t she?
Itaru|I’m sure it’s for the customers! She probably doesn’t want to inconvenience the store. Truly a model maid.
Itaru|Also, she’s Mayushii’s age, so she probably has school too.
Rintaro|She doesn’t want to inconvenience the store, yet she’s holding the Faris Cup here?
Itaru|That doesn’t matter at all!
Itaru|The point is, Faris is cute, and cuteness is justice. Cute cat-eared maids are sweet, if you know what I mean. And that’s all that matters, right?
Rintaro|So in the end, do you bat for the 2D team, or the 3D team?
Itaru|I dare say I’m bi!
Rintaro|You’re an inspiration, Daru. 
Itaru|I know. I’m just too awesome.
Rintaro|Hey, Daru. What’s with the X68000?
Itaru|It’s cool. Duh.
Rintaro|So, it’s like the reason why some protagonists are odd-eyed even though they’re Japanese?
Itaru|Not getting you, bro.
Rintaro|It’s cool.
Itaru|If it’s cool, then it’s cool.
Itaru|Anyway, there wasn’t much of an option. This was the only PC we weren’t using.
Rintaro|What about your new one?
Itaru|No way. We don’t know what could happen when it’s connected to your crazy machine. It could kill the performance.
Itaru|Anyway, did you do any research on the gelification?
Rintaro|Yeah, at the university this morning.
Rintaro|I examined a sample under a microscope and found it was shredded at the molecular level.
Itaru|Shredded?
Rintaro|It’s not a mere phase transition. The banana became something entirely different.
Itaru|Could it have rotted? ...Nah. There’s no way 2 minutes in the microwave could do that.
Rintaro|Then I remembered about fractal structures.
Itaru|The Menger sponge thing?
Rintaro|Yeah. It looked like something drilled holes into the banana. An infinite number of holes in a fractal pattern, right down to the nano level.
Itaru|Whoa. What could do something like that?
Rintaro|I have one hypothesis...
Rintaro|It’s the result of the microwave’s electromagnetic waves.
Itaru|W-what does that mean?
Rintaro|If my guess is correct, then our PhoneWave (name subject to change) has the potential to become a weapon of unprecedented destructive power, one that could change the face of war as we know it. Hehehe.
Rintaro|It’s me. We’re proceeding to stage two of the plan. Soon they will learn... that Judgment Day is near.
Rintaro|All shall be as Steins Gate wills. Resistance is futile. El Psy Kongroo.
Itaru|Quit talking to your imaginary friend. I’m done with the wiring.
Itaru|Well? What’s next?
Rintaro|We have bananas.
Itaru|You know Mayu-shi’s gonna cry if you use them all, right? Wasn’t it her money?
Rintaro|She donated that money to our research efforts.
Itaru|You don’t have to use the whole thing. One is enough. One.
Rintaro|We’ll never reshape the fabric of society as long as money dictates the limits of our science.
Itaru|You’re the only one who wants to reshape society, Okarin.
Itaru|C’mon, start the timer already.
Guidance|Hello. This is the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Guidance|You can operate the timer from this menu.
Guidance|After pushing the # button, please enter the heating time in seconds.
Rintaro|In hindsight, we should’ve made the Mayushii Guidance skippable. Having to wait each time is quite annoying.
Guidance|For example, press ’#60’ for one minute.
Guidance|For two minutes, press ’#120’.
Itaru|You messed up.
Rintaro|Two minutes sure is long...
Itaru|You know, if the microwave’s emissions are doing it, then shouldn’t our cells be getting gelified too?
Rintaro|Well, have you ever nuked yourself inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change)?
Itaru|I can’t even fit in there.
Itaru|Anyway, what’s your source on the electromagnetic waves?
Rintaro|If you must know... it’s my mad scientist’s intuition.
Itaru|Oh, so no facts.
Rintaro|Edison once said, ’Without one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent of perspiration is wasted. So, inventors of the world... be inspired!’ End quote.
Itaru|Wasn’t it ’Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration’?
Rintaro|Sorry to disappoint, but in recent years it’s become common knowledge that that is a misquote. Muhahaha!
Itaru|Edison said that? ’Be inspired!’...?
Rintaro|Yes. ’Be inspired!’ he said.
Rintaro|Therefore, as a genius mad scientist, I am always insp--
Rintaro|This is just going to gelify the banana like usual, isn’t it? We need a new experiment.
Itaru|What? What!?
Rintaro|What are you doing?
Itaru|Well... uh... it’s...
Itaru|...gone.
Rintaro|Gone? What’s gone?
Itaru|The banana.
Rintaro|...It’s gone.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|It’s me. Slight problem. We may have awakened something... terrible.
Itaru|Wh-what do you mean something terrible!?
Rintaro|I’m invoking Emergency Order 666. Activate the Coldheart Protocol!
Rintaro|What!? What do you mean we need congressional approval!? There’s no time, you fool! Tokyo will be blasted to atoms!
Itaru|Y-you should be an actor.
Rintaro|S-shut up, you Faris stalker! Where’d you hide the banana?
Itaru|Who’s a stalker!?
Rintaro|The banana. Where is it? Are you planning on become a street magician or something?
Itaru|You’re the one who hid it, aren’t you?
Rintaro|...
Itaru|...
Rintaro|Where the hell did it go!?
Itaru|How should I know!?
Rintaro|Where did you go? Banaana! BANAAANA!
Rintaro|W-wait... I think I get it now! It’s not an electromagnetic weapon, it’s a teleportation device!
Itaru|Wh-what!?
Itaru|Wait, that’s absurd.
Rintaro|How else could it have vanished? The microwave was closed!
Itaru|Um, maybe we should just calm down.
Rintaro|Y-yeah. You’re right...
Rintaro|What... the...!?
Itaru|Oh shit! What the hell’s going on?
Rintaro|Wait! How many bananas are in the lab right now!?
Itaru|J-just these, I think...
Rintaro|Is this gelbana attached to the same stem as the banana you just picked?
Itaru|I dunno, man... I wasn’t paying attention.
Itaru|It doesn’t look like it was ever plucked...
Rintaro|H-hey, Daru... could this possibly be...
Rintaro|A teleporter... we’ve invented a teleporter!
???|Oh?
???|That looks like an interesting experiment.
Rintaro|Who’s there!?
Rintaro|Impossible! What are you doing here!?
Rintaro|The 18-year-old genius girl! A sadist who humiliates men in public! Also known as The Zombie!
Rintaro|Makise... Kurisu!
Itaru|Nice exposition, bro. 
Kurisu|Who are you calling a zombie?
Rintaro|What is the meaning of this!? What is your purpose here?
Kurisu|I’m here to see you, Okabe Rintaro-san. Or is it Hououin Kyouma-san?
Rintaro|I was right! You’re one of the Organization’s top agents, an esper with superhuman powers!
Rintaro|No wonder you rose from the dead!
Kurisu|I’m not dead, alright? Please stop killing me off.
Kurisu|Hashida-san, can you do something about this guy?
Itaru|You came at a bad time, Makise-shi, with Okarin freaking out like this.
Rintaro|Have you betrayed me, Daru!?
Itaru|Calm down, man.
Rintaro|Are you being blackmailed? Or did she seduce you?
Rintaro|YOU’VE CROSSED THE LINE, BIIITTCH!
Kurisu|Get ahold of yourself.
Kurisu|Hashida-san gave me the address after yesterday’s lecture. He also told me your name.
Rintaro|So you’re here to see me, is that it?
Kurisu|Yes. You claimed to have seen me die. I came to see if that was the truth, or just a pathetic excuse to grope me. I came for the answer.
Kurisu|But your current behavior is all the answer I need. It was all an act to grope me. My initial hypothesis was correct.
Rintaro|Not so fast. There’s more to this than you know.
Kurisu|Anyway, let’s put that aside for now.
Rintaro|R-really?
Kurisu|I haven’t properly introduced myself yet, have I? I’m Makise Kurisu. Pleased to meet you.
Kurisu|You can’t even shake hands? Are all Japanese men this difficult?
Rintaro|You’re not Japanese!?
Kurisu|I’ve lived in America for seven years. What about it?
Rintaro|America...
Kurisu|What’s your problem?
Rintaro|I can feel your aura of malice. You must be a powerful kung-fu master.
Kurisu|Don’t be ridiculous.
Rintaro|Then you’re a NINJA--
Kurisu|Give it a rest.
Rintaro|If you grew up in America, shouldn’t you say ’HAHAHA! NICE TO MEET YOU!’ with a smile across your whole face when asking for a handshake?
Rintaro|No, wait, you should be asking for a hug, right?
Kurisu|What kind of stereotype is that?
Kurisu|...Fascinating.
Kurisu|Have any forceps?
Rintaro|No!
Kurisu|Oh.
Rintaro|What are you doing!? That’s precious data!
Kurisu|It’s squishy.
Kurisu|...No taste. Gross.
Rintaro|You have quite the appetite, I see. A side-effect of the resurrection, perhaps? If you’re that hungry, I guess I could give you a banana or two!
Kurisu|No thanks.
Itaru|Either way, those bananas are Mayushii’s.
Rintaro|Come, don’t be shy. This is an offering. Take it!
Kurisu|As if. Who would eat some perv’s banana?
Itaru|A perv’s banana...!
Itaru|Eat... a perv’s banana... squishy... finger in mouth... ’Gross!’ with a sour expression...
Itaru|Um, can you say that one more time? With a more humiliated expression, if you please.
Kurisu|Huh?
Itaru|Come on. Say, ’Who would eat some perv’s banana?’ but if you could add an, ’Ahh, but it’s so...’ after that, it would be extra delicious!
Kurisu|Huh? ...huh?
Kurisu|...Ah!!
Rintaro|Muhaha! Oh, Daru. You may be a worthless, disgusting perv, but let me say, well done, sir!
Rintaro|So, Makise Kurisu. You just imagined something, didn’t you? By all means, tell us what. Don’t be shy. Muhahaha!
Kurisu|Why you...
Rintaro|Come on! Say it, genius girl! What’s the imagination of a genius like? I’d love to hear from you!
Kurisu|You... ass!
Kurisu|I get it. You’re both pervs.
Itaru|Well... you could say that.
Rintaro|I don’t want to hear that from you.
Kurisu|Okay! If I came off as a little rude, I apologize.
Kurisu|I was only acting that way because you molested me, but I’ll ignore that for now.
Kurisu|Please tell me what happened to this banana. I’d also like to hear about that...
Kurisu|That microwave thing.
Rintaro|That’s top secret. The one thing I’m cleared to share with unauthorized individuals is that its name is the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Kurisu|Name subject to change? What’s that about?
Rintaro|PhoneWave is weak. It needs a better name.
Kurisu|I couldn’t care less about its name.
Rintaro|I’m afraid that’s the only information you’re cleared for.
Itaru|Hold on, Okarin. Makise-shi might be able to explain what’s going on.
Rintaro|Hmm... well...
Kurisu|That creepy grin... are you thinking perverted thoughts again?
Rintaro|You said your name’s Christina, right?
Kurisu|Who the hell’s Christina!? I never said that!
Rintaro|If you wish to learn the secrets of this microwave, then you must meet my conditions.
Kurisu|...Which are?
Rintaro|Condition One: You must become a lab mem.
Kurisu|Ramen?
Rintaro|No! Lab mem, stupid! Short for laboratory member!
Kurisu|You mean you want me to join your research team? I’m supposed to return to America in August.
Rintaro|I’ll have you sign a non-disclosure agreement so you won’t betray our secrets. Break the agreement, and I’ll report your steamy, perverted acts to Science Magazine.
Kurisu|Gh...
Itaru|You’re a monster, Okarin. I’ll take five copies.
Rintaro|From the moment you become a lab mem to the moment of your departure, your brain shall be used for the benefit of our lab.
Kurisu|You’re so full of it. Let’s see the contract, then.
Rintaro|What contract? This is a lab, not a corporation!
Kurisu|I don’t mind lending you my knowledge, but if there is more pervy nonsense involved, the answer is NO.
Rintaro|Don’t worry, we don’t bite.
Kurisu|No more molestation?
Rintaro|No, alright!?
Kurisu|You said that was condition one. So there’s gotta be a second one, right? It better not be--
Rintaro|The second condition is...
Rintaro|That you’ll overlook all past acts of molestation I may or may not have committed!
Kurisu|...
Itaru|Okarin, you’re so petty! You’re the pettiest person I’ve ever met! That’s why we love you! That’s why we admire you!
Rintaro|Shut up, Daru. You have no right to talk. By the way, Daru’s perverted acts aren’t included. You two can work it out yourselves.
Itaru|What the hell, man!
Rintaro|Those are the conditions! If you can’t accept them, then you must leave at once!
Rintaro|Heh heh heh. So what’ll it be? I don’t think it’s a bad deal at all.
Kurisu|You mean for you.
Kurisu|Geez... I feel like I’m hypersecreting noradrenaline. Let me pick my jaw up off the floor.
Rintaro|I don’t care about your dislocated jaw! Do you accept the conditions or not? Answer me, Christina!
Kurisu|Stop adding -tina! My name’s Kurisu!
Kurisu|...Okay. I accept.
Rintaro|Hehehe, good answer. From this moment forth, you are Lab Mem Number 004.
Rintaro|Welcome, Christina -- codename, The Zombie!
Kurisu|I won’t answer to either. Use my real name, Hououin.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|You’re such a child.
Rintaro|You say something? Genius perv girl?
Kurisu|Come on! No more saying ’perv’! I won’t treat you like a perv either! So let’s drop it already!
Rintaro|As long as you understand. Now for the issue at hand. Daru, give Christina--
Kurisu|No ’-tina’ either.
Rintaro|Give Kurisu-kun an explanation on our experiments so far.
Itaru|But I refuse.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|Fascinating.
Rintaro|Let’s hear your opinion.
Kurisu|I think we can at least throw out completely worthless theories like electromagnetic weaponry and teleportation.
Kurisu|Can we run the experiment one more time? I want to see it for myself.
Kurisu|Okabe-san, Hashida-san, please watch the bananas.
Rintaro|Who are you to give me orders? I am the mad scientist, Houou--
Kurisu|Whatever. Just keep your eye on the bananas!
Kurisu|Sixty seconds have passed. Any change?
Itaru|Nope.
Kurisu|100 seconds.
Itaru|Ah!
Itaru|It appeared!
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|How does it look?
Kurisu|Huh? Oh... uh...
Kurisu|A-at 104 seconds, it d-disappeared. Abruptly. Yeah.
Rintaro|So it is a teleporter! The first in human history!
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|Teleportation... is that even possible?
Kurisu|It did move... No matter how unbelievable that may be...
Kurisu|Could it be quantum teleportation... no, that only occurs on the quantum level...
Rintaro|Don’t avert your eyes from the truth! What you’ve seen with your own eyes is everything!
Kurisu|Did it really teleport? It’s dangerous to reason from the conclusion.
Rintaro|Well then, genius girl, what do you call this phenomenon?
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|Let’s sort this out.
Kurisu|Neither the banana bunch nor the frozen chicken teleported. Correct?
Rintaro|...So, maybe there’s a size limit for objects that can teleport.
Kurisu|But aren’t those chicken pieces smaller than bananas?
Rintaro|We used the same chicken for each experiment. They come in 12-packs.
Itaru|That’s quite a lot, then.
Kurisu|What about salt? You experimented with salt too, right?
Kurisu|Maybe the plate was in the way.
Rintaro|Of course we tried it without the plate, but that didn’t change anything.
Kurisu|Then, maybe each individual grain of salt was too small... or something?
Kurisu|Hmm... I need a clue...
Kurisu|Anything else? Have you noticed anything else about the PhoneWave?
Rintaro|Not PhoneWave. PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Kurisu|Forget about that.
Kurisu|So? Have you noticed anything or not?
Itaru|Oh, right!
Itaru|One time, it shot off a huge electrical discharge.
Rintaro|What!? I don’t know anything about that!
Itaru|That’s because you weren’t around when it happened.
Kurisu|Discharge? How much?
Itaru|It was like a fluorescent light lit up the development room. It lasted about two seconds, I guess.
Kurisu|What were the circumstances?
Itaru|I was adjusting the cellphone attached to it. I unhooked it and put my own in.
Itaru|A little bit later, sparky sparky.
Rintaro|When was that?
Itaru|Around noon yesterday. When you went to see Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation.
Kurisu|Doctor Nakabachi...
Rintaro|But wait, Daru. Didn’t you say that Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation was cancelled?
Itaru|Yeah, but you went with Mayu-shi anyway, remember?
Rintaro|That reminds me. I sent you an email back then. Did you get it?
Itaru|An email?
Kurisu|That email you showed me at ATF yesterday?
Kurisu|It said someone stabbed me at the presentation, didn’t it?
Rintaro|Yeah. But for some reason, Daru’s phone received it a week ago...
Itaru|Huh? Wasn’t that one of your stories? If it wasn’t, then that would make the timestamp weird.
Rintaro|I always speak the truth! If you don’t trust me, I’ll show you my send history.
Rintaro|It’s gone...
Rintaro|Where did it go? I could’ve sworn I sent it just before 1 PM.
Itaru|Oh yeah! That’s when the discharge phenomenon happened! The show I was watching was about to end.
Rintaro|I get it... So that’s what happened.
Kurisu|Uh, what?
Itaru|Oh, this is one of Okarin’s usual habits, so don’t mind it. Seriously.
Rintaro|Silence! I’ve reached the answer, and now the world will tremble!
Rintaro|The disappearance of my mail, the strange timestamp, and the sudden electrical discharge must be...
Rintaro|Related somehow!
Itaru|...
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...And?
Rintaro|Huh?
Kurisu|I understand that they’re related somehow. But how?
Rintaro|It’s your job to figure that out, Christina.
Kurisu|Hashida-san, talking to this guy’s so tiring.
Itaru|Everyone’s like that at first. The trick is to not take him seriously.
Rintaro|And you call yourself my right-hand man!?
Rintaro|Daru, describe the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s status when the discharge phenomenon occurred.
Itaru|It was kind of a mess. I’d connected my phone to the PhoneWave, and I was testing to see if I could control it with the X68000.
Mayuri|I’m home! So hungry...
Mayuri|Time to eat some chicken! Juicy Chicken Number One♪
Mayuri|Okarin, did you buy the bananas? Okarin?
Mayuri|Huh? We have a guest?
Mayuri|I’m Mayushii. Nice to meet you!
Kurisu|I’m Makise. Apparently, I’m a lab mem now.
Mayuri|Really? That’s great! Another girl lab mem!
Rintaro|Daru, what were you doing with the X68000?
Itaru|Like I said, I was adjusting the incoming mail settings. I was monitoring the moment it received mail for remote control.
Itaru|That’s why I put it on ’freezing mode’ for 120 seconds too.
Itaru|I made it so that you can start freezing mode by computer. I tested that out yesterday too.
Rintaro|Mayuri! Insert the Juicy Chicken Number One into the PhoneWave (name subject to change)!
Mayuri|You all want some? I can give you one each.
Rintaro|So, we’ve reproduced the conditions that existed when the discharge phenomenon occurred. Right?
Itaru|Uhh, how was it again...
Rintaro|You there. Assistant!
Kurisu|Huh? Me?
Rintaro|Who else!?
Kurisu|When did I become your assistant!?
Rintaro|Just send something to my phone!
Kurisu|I don’t even know your email address.
Rintaro|What a useless assistant.
Kurisu|Don’t call me your assistant!
Rintaro|Daru, send an email from your phone!
Itaru|Uh, sure... but what?
Rintaro|Anything!
Itaru|Uhh, umm...
Rintaro|Send ’Christina’s a perv’!
Kurisu|I thought we agreed to stop saying that!
Itaru|Well, let’s compromise and go with ’Okarin’s a perv’.
Rintaro|You traitor!
Kurisu|Good job, Hashida-san!
Mayuri|Oh no! Mayushii’s bananas!
Mayuri|They became gelbanas...
Kurisu|We experimented on them.
Mayuri|But they were Mayushii’s...
Itaru|Want me to send the mail now?
Kurisu|You’ll be reimbursed later. By Hououin-san, that is.
Rintaro|Why me!?
Mayuri|Geez! Why do you always have to experiment on Mayushii’s food?
Mayuri|Ah! Don’t tell me you’re experimenting on the chicken too?
Rintaro|We are.
Itaru|’Kay, sending it now. Sending, sending, click.
Rintaro|Wait! Don’t open that!
Mayuri|Huh?
Mayuri|Wawah!
Kurisu|An electrical discharge!
Itaru|Are we gonna die!?
Rintaro|E-everyone okay?
Itaru|S-somehow.
Kurisu|That was definitely more than two seconds.
Mayuri|O-Okarin? Umm, what just happened?
Rintaro|Are you okay? No burns or anything?
Mayuri|Hmm... It doesn’t hurt anywhere, so I think I’m okay...
Kurisu|H-hey! Look at this!
Itaru|What the hell? How did that... Yeah, it’s a microwave, but it’s not heavy enough to make a hole in the floor...
Kurisu|This can’t be caused by electrical discharge. Some other phenomenon?
Rintaro|Heh... heh heh heh... MUHAHAHA! Just as my calculations predicted!
Itaru|...So, about Mayu-shi’s chicken.
Mayuri|Eh?
Mayuri|Ahh! M-Mayushii’s chicken is all burnt black...
Rintaro|Juicy Chicken Number One made a noble sacrifice for the progress of science. Let us pray for his happiness in the next life.
Kurisu|The chicken doesn’t matter! Right now, we need to determine what happened with the Phonewa--
Mayuri|It doesn’t matter? That’s so mean, uh, Christina-chan...
Kurisu|Hey, Hououin Kyouma! Do something about this! Mayushii-san learned my name wrong!
Itaru|More importantly, we need ventilation. *cough cough*
Rintaro|Silence, all of you!
Rintaro|Muhaha! Muhahaha! MUHAHAHAHA!
Rintaro|It all connects. There’s a meaning behind this series of events, and only one true answer.
Rintaro|I’ve discovered the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s true hidden function!
Rintaro|This isn’t intuition. That’s right. This is conviction!
Kurisu|Just spit it out. What do you think it is?
Rintaro|First, let me say one thing. The greatest inventions are created by accident. This we call serendipity.
Kurisu|Get on with it.
Rintaro|The mail was sent to the past.
Rintaro|The chicken returned to its frozen state.
Rintaro|The plucked banana returned to the bunch.
Kurisu|...No way.
Rintaro|Yes way!
Rintaro|The PhoneWave (name subject to change)...
Rintaro|Is a time machine!
Itaru|...
Kurisu|A time machine? A time machine!? It can’t be!!
Rintaro|Hey, wanna go to Sanbo for some beef bowl?
Itaru|Nah, too much trouble...
Rintaro|Aren’t you hungry?
Itaru|Yeah, but...
Rintaro|Hmph. You’re such a bum.
Itaru|Haa...
Itaru|The Large Hadron Collider sure is cute...
Rintaro|W-what!? What did you just say!?
Itaru|Large Hadron Collider. You don’t know about it?
Itaru|Owowowowowow, what are you doing!?
Rintaro|Are you conscious?
Itaru|Of course, man.
Rintaro|What is this Large Hadron Collider thing?
Itaru|You know. It’s what SERN uses to do their experiments. LHC for short.
Itaru|It’s seriously moe. Recommended.
Rintaro|You’re lusting for something that’s not even humanoid?
Itaru|Of course not. But there’s something about it that gets me excited, you know? It makes me smile, you know? Don’t you feel that?
Rintaro|Come to think of it, I remember you said that you found factories and the undersides of highways irresistible or something.
Itaru|Yeah. Same thing.
Rintaro|Where does it end?
Itaru|Life’s too short. I don’t want to limit my interests, you know?
Rintaro|SERN...
Rintaro|John Titor!
Itaru|Oh yeah. That guy you mentioned earlier. He’s the guy @channel’s going crazy about, isn’t he?
Rintaro|That one might be an impostor. I was talking about the John Titor who appeared ten years ago.
Itaru|He appeared ten years ago? The same guy?
Rintaro|Anyway, John Titor mentioned SERN.
Rintaro|Titor made a prediction. Namely, that before the year 2034, SERN will develop a time machine!
Itaru|A time machine? That’s a timely topic.
Itaru|But that wasn’t just ten years ago. This new Titor said the same thing.
Rintaro|It doesn’t matter if it was ten years ago or ten seconds ago. That’s not the point, Daru.
Rintaro|This coincidence could very well be the choice of Steins Gate!
Itaru|Can we trust this Titor guy?
Rintaro|It doesn’t matter if we trust him or not! Now we have something in common -- a time machine.
Rintaro|We should investigate SERN! We’ve got nothing to lose!
Rintaro|Tell me everything you know about SERN.
Itaru|Sure thing. My SERN folder is smoking hot!
Itaru|SERN is the world’s largest particle physics research institution. It’s popularly called the ’European Laboratory for Particle Physics’, or the ’European Organization for Nuclear Research’.
Itaru|It’s close to the border of Switzerland and France, on the outskirts of Geneva. It’s famous as the birthplace of HTML, HTTP, and the World Wide Web.
Rintaro|The World Wide Web? You mean the internet?
Itaru|Bingo. That thing at the beginning of most URLs.
Itaru|Most people aren’t aware, but there’s a Japanese research team working at SERN too.
Rintaro|What sort of research does SERN do?
Itaru|Particle physics, mostly.
Itaru|SERN can do experiments no one else can, because they have the biggest particle accelerators in the world.
Itaru|The Low Energy Antiproton Ring, the Proton Synchrotron Booster, the Large Electron-Positron Collider.
Itaru|And the big boss is the largest accelerator in the world, the LHC... Large Hadron Collider-tan.
Itaru|The LHC is a 27km-long circular tunnel built underneath SERN’s headquarters.
Itaru|Its purpose is to smash protons together in the hope of creating unknown elementary particle reactions. They started experimenting last year.
Itaru|Before they started, there were rumors that the experiments might create mini black holes.
Itaru|Oh no! Those mini black holes will swallow the earth! The universe is in danger! etc.
Rintaro|What’s the possibility of that actually happening?
Itaru|100% that it... won’t. SERN officially denies it.
Itaru|Let’s say a mini black hole was formed. The amount of energy would be so tiny that it would disappear instantly upon formation. It would be impossible for it to swallow the world.
Rintaro|But where there’s smoke, there’s fire.
Rintaro|It’s me. Hehehe, don’t be surprised. I’ve sniffed out an evil conspiracy.
Rintaro|...John Titor. SERN. You see where I’m going with this? ...Yeah, that’s right. They’re likely connected to the Organization.
Rintaro|Hmph, coincidence? Come now, don’t disappoint me. ...What? Evidence? Well, if you must know... whispers. Whispers of my mad scientist intuition.
Rintaro|Those bastards are trying to destroy the world. ...Yeah, with mini black holes. But what if we were to steal that technology? What then?
Rintaro|...Heh heh heh. Of course. Who do you think I am? Everything is the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo.
Itaru|Just who the hell are you fighting with?
Rintaro|Daru, I know what we must do.
Itaru|Whuzzat?
Rintaro|Don’t you ’whuzzat’ me! You’re supposed to grin like you know exactly what I’m talking about! What kind of super hacka are you!?
Itaru|You always give such half-baked explanations. Try to sound intelligible before you try to sound intelligent.
Rintaro|You are a super hacka.
Itaru|Stop saying hacka. At least say hacker.
Rintaro|See where I’m going with this?
Itaru|No, not at all.
Rintaro|Hack into SERN.
Itaru|...Is that some kind of joke?
Rintaro|I know you can do it, Daru. Expose their dastardly deeds and find any hints you can about the time machine.
Itaru|Dastardly deeds? You’re just imagining that stuff, Okarin.
Rintaro|We stand at a crossroads. Will the PhoneWave (name subject to change) become a functional time machine, or will it die as garbage in lab storage?
Itaru|You serious?
Rintaro|I’m always serious!
Itaru|I’m not responsible for the consequences, got it?
Rintaro|Deal. Get started.
Itaru|Let’s do this!
Rintaro|For your payment, I’ll deposit a week’s supply of potato chips into your Swiss bank account.
Itaru|...
Rintaro|Anyway, I’m gonna sleep. It’s all yours.
???|Anyone home?
Girl|Hi! I’m from the Braun Tube Workshop.
Girl|The TV you sent in for repairs has been fixed. Mind picking it up?
Girl|Why do we have to be sneaky?
Rintaro|Currently, my genius partner in crime is executing an important mission. I don’t want to bother him.
Suzuha|Hmmm. What exactly do you guys do?
Rintaro|I told you before that learning our secrets could put you and everyone you know in grave danger.
Suzuha|You’re called the Future Gadget Laboratory, right?
Rintaro|How did you know that!? I never told you. Wait, are you an Organization spy!?
Suzuha|That’s what it said on your mailbox.
Rintaro|...Oh.
Rintaro|N-now that you know, it’s not like you can un-know. I’ll give you the short explanation. But you must not tell a soul.
Rintaro|We are the Future Gadget Laboratory, dedicated to defeating the evil organization that rules the world from the shadows. Muhahaha!
Suzuha|Wow...
Suzuha|Is the evil organization SERN?
Rintaro|...!?
Rintaro|Y-yeah, but...
Suzuha|Oh! So I was right? Those guys really are a contemptible lot, aren’t they?
Rintaro|How did you know we were hacking into SERN!?
Suzuha|What? You’re hacking them? Right now?
Rintaro|Just answer my question! How did you know about our business with SERN!?
Suzuha|Ah, umm, well...
Suzuha|Weeell, ahahah, actually, I overheard you this afternoon. If you stand here, you can hear stuff from the window.
Suzuha|I’ve only been working here for a day, but...
Suzuha|I’ve got a lot more free time than I expected. I’ve gone out four or five times today. Figured I’d reconnoiter the front of the store, see if I couldn’t spot any customers.
Suzuha|So that’s when I heard you guys talking from the second floor.
Suzuha|I got interested and looked it up online. Now I know all the rumors about SERN.
Rintaro|...A-anyway, you must not tell anyone else.
Suzuha|Ah, yeah. I understand. I’m actually tight lipped, so don’t worry.
Rintaro|Where’s the manager?
Suzuha|He left right after he finished repairing your TV.
Suzuha|Sooo, here’s the fixed TV.
Suzuha|He said to charge 1000 yen.
Suzuha|Thanks for your patronage. Well, just take it away.
Rintaro|By myself? Are you joking?
Suzuha|Huh? Didn’t you bring it here by yourself?
Suzuha|I guess I can help, but... oh, I see. So we’re already in the age where women do physical labor.
Rintaro|Hmph. I don’t remember anyone asking for your help. Honestly, getting help from a girl like you would just hurt my pride.
Suzuha|Wow!
Suzuha|That was so manly! I might be falling for you.
Rintaro|Hmph, you think you can trick me like that? You’re lying, aren’t you?
Suzuha|Eh? What makes you think that?
Rintaro|It’s one of my powers... Coloring Gentleman.
Suzuha|Y-you have powers?
Suzuha|Are you some kind of esper?
Suzuha|Are there a lot of espers like you?
Rintaro|Of course not. I am special!
Suzuha|Oh... You had me scared for a second there. But still, it’s amazing that people like you exist. Maybe SERN is the reason there aren’t more where I came from...
Suzuha|By the way, does the ability to see through lies have any combat application at all?
Suzuha|If it were me, I’d want perfect accuracy within a thousand meters, or ultra-fast reflexes that let me tear my enemy’s limbs off before they can react.
Rintaro|You... you’re an Organization assassin, aren’t you? You must be the one they call Miss Golgo! Who hired you!?
Suzuha|Nobody hired me. What’s a Golgo?
Suzuha|Anyway, do you have any other powers?
Rintaro|Even if I did, there’s no way I’d tell a hitman hired to kill me.
Suzuha|I’m not going to kill you.
Rintaro|Revealing my powers would be suicide. They are most effective with the element of surprise. In other words, they’re for me to know and you to find out!
Suzuha|Meanie.
Rintaro|Say what you like.
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|Why the frown? Did you get a death notice?
Rintaro|A what?
Suzuha|...J-just wondering.
Suzuha|Umm, what I meant to ask was if you got some unpleasant news.
Rintaro|...You could say that.
Rintaro|There’s this woman who’s obsessed with finding an IBN 5100.
Suzuha|An IBN 5100?
Rintaro|You know about them?
Suzuha|Yeah...
Rintaro|I see. So the IBN 5100 legend is famous, huh.
Suzuha|Y-yeah, that’s it. I heard the urban legend from someone. How much do you know about it?
Rintaro|I actually tried looking for an IBN 5100, but in the end, I came to the conclusion that there isn’t one in Akiba.
Suzuha|...I see. Well, that’s true.
Rintaro|You sound like you know something.
Suzuha|Eh? Well, I do and I don’t, I guess.
Suzuha|I don’t know about it personally, but I happened to hear about it from a knowledgeable acquaintance of mine or something like that. Aha, ahaha.
Suzuha|...
Rintaro|Who are you?
Suzuha|Haaahh...
Suzuha|I was thinking of giving you a bunch of interesting information on the IBN 5100...
Suzuha|But when you look at me like that, I don’t feel like it anymore.
Rintaro|I’m not even interested in the IBN 5100.
Rintaro|You don’t have a shred of credibility. I have no way of knowing if that ’interesting information’ of yours is true or not.
Suzuha|Wow, that’s harsh! Well, I admit I am acting kinda suspicious.
Suzuha|I won’t tell you, but I’ll give you a hint.
Suzuha|And then you’ll writhe in agony when you can’t figure it out!
Suzuha|Truth is, the IBN 5100 has a hidden function.
Rintaro|If I remember correctly, the IBN 5100 can do something or other with a proprietary programming language.
Suzuha|No way! How did you know!? Tell me, tell me!
Rintaro|It’s another one of my powers -- Leading Question. I can read your heart of hearts.
Suzuha|What!? No fair!
Rintaro|I see everything, Amane Suzuha! Resistance is futile.
Suzuha|Kuh!
Suzuha|Anyway, the IBN 5100 has a hidden function!
Suzuha|It can decipher IBN’s proprietary programming language, which was written before APL and BASIC became widespread. Isn’t that surprising?
Suzuha|Now it’s a dead programming language that can only be deciphered with an IBN 5100.
Suzuha|That’s why IBN 5100s are so rare.
Itaru|...
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Good morning!
Rintaro|What are you doing here so early?
Mayuri|Well, I heard you guys had stayed up two nights in a row, so I brought you some goodies.
Rintaro|Excellent. Good job.
Mayuri|Tada! Canned oden!
Mayuri|It’s a present from Mayushii. They’re 270 yen each, so savor it, okay?
Rintaro|I’ve been getting tired of eating bananas and chicken lately. Buy these instead from now on.
Mayuri|But Mayushii doesn’t have enough pocket money to splurge like this all the time.
Mayuri|And Mayushii loves bananas and chicken, so she’ll keep buying them.
Mayuri|But wait, there’s more. Tada♪
Mayuri|RaiNet sausage! It comes with an Upa bottle cap as a bonus! I really wanted it, so I bought it.
Mayuri|So how’s Daru-kun?
Rintaro|He’s in the midst of a hard fight. He should at least rest a little. I mean, I never said he had to do it all at once.
Mayuri|Daru-kun’s super hacka spirit is on fire!
Itaru|Don’t say hacka!
Mayuri|He sure is tense...
Mayuri|But, isn’t hacking bad? Mayushii doesn’t want you to do bad things...
Rintaro|I would be a fool to let Daru’s super hacka... I mean, hacker skills go to waste.
Rintaro|Besides, we’re doing this to expose SERN’s wrongdoings. This is a war against the dark forces that secretly rule the world!
Mayuri|Bad things are bad.
Rintaro|Mayuri, want to trade my sweet potatoes for your beef?
Mayuri|Ehh? If you want to trade, I’d rather have your quail egg.
Rintaro|Don’t be ridiculous! Next to beef, quail eggs are my favorite.
Mayuri|But Mayushii likes quail eggs too.
Rintaro|Settle for my chikuwa.
Mayuri|Mm... okay. Chikuwa’s better than sweet potatoes.
Itaru|Soon... If I can just get the SQL table, I’ll have more than enough passwords... geheheh... you’re no match for me...
Itaru|Oho! Comeoncomeoncomeon, mmyes, mmyes, hooah! You can’t hide from me, you naughty thing you! How does it feel to be naked? Hyahaaa! Hahaha!
Itaru|Oh yes! YESSSSSSS! Matching ID and password! Login complete, hell yeah! Taste it! YESYESYES!
Rintaro|Did you get it!?
Itaru|Mission complete.
Rintaro|Really!?
Mayuri|Wow, that’s amazing! I don’t really get it, though.
Itaru|An oden can’s the best after a job well done.
Rintaro|Well done! You really are the world’s greatest super hacka!
Itaru|Hacker.
Rintaro|H-hacker! I’m glad you’re on my side.
Rintaro|So, did you find out how they’re planning to destroy the world?
Itaru|I haven’t looked yet, man. All I did was get us connected.
Itaru|But it’s all downhill from here.
Rintaro|I’m sorry if you’re tired, but please start checking. The keys to this conspiracy have got to be in there.
Itaru|Yeah, yeah, I’ll do it. But let me eat this oden can first.
Itaru|The question is who this password belongs to.
Mayuri|Why is that?
Itaru|I went into SERN’s database and got a data table. From there, I focused on people with simple passwords like 11111111 and ABCDEFGH to get my hands on an ID.
Itaru|It’d be awesome if this turns out to be the server admin’s logon, but I don’t think we’re that lucky.
Mayuri|In Japanese please?
Rintaro|Same.
Itaru|Basically, if this is the server admin’s password, we can taste every inch of SERN’s luscious, luscious flesh. But if it’s just an ordinary researcher’s password, then we can only see SERN’s boobs.
Mayuri|Daru-kun, that’s naughty!
Rintaro|Quit the erotic examples. Basically, you mean there’ll be limits to what information we can access.
Itaru|Exactly.
Itaru|Anyway, it’s only a matter of time before I get a server admin’s password. Let’s save that for later. I’m really sleepy now.
Itaru|Oh! Looks like our ID belongs to an accelerator division chief.
Rintaro|So it’s not a server admin...
Itaru|It would take a miracle to get one on our first try. How many staff members do you think SERN has?
Mayuri|How many?
Itaru|Over 6000.
Itaru|Well, for now, let’s look at this accelerator division chief. Uh, his name is...
Itaru|Jack. Let’s look at his email log.
Mayuri|Oh no... that makes Mayushii’s head hurt...
Rintaro|Daru, what does that say?
Itaru|Need to translate it...
Rintaro|This is a job for Dr.Excite!
Itaru|Nah. I’ve got a better idea.
Itaru|Looks like a new year’s greeting. Something about going on vacation in Spain... lucky bastard.
Itaru|If we keep scouring the log like this, we can also identify the server manager.
Mayuri|You know, looking through someone else’s email without permission makes me feel really guilty...
Rintaro|I abandoned guilt when I chose the path of Evil long ago! Muhahaha!
Rintaro|Let the responsibility be mine. I will not ask you to answer for my crimes.
Itaru|What a guy! I’d let Okarin do me in the butt.
Rintaro|I decline your offer.
Rintaro|Now get peeking, Daru!
Mayuri|Okarin, you’re bad... You make Mayushii sad.
Rintaro|LHC experiment reports? There could be a hint about time machines in there. We should try reading them.
Itaru|This is definitely a crime, though...
Itaru|This is encrypted.
Rintaro|Tch, of course it isn’t that simple...
Itaru|Well, cracking this should be a piece of cake. 
Itaru|Umm, translated into proper Japanese, it’s...
Itaru|’Hi, Pole!’
Rintaro|That acting’s completely unnecessary.
Itaru|Aw...
Itaru|’Uploaded today’s data to the server. The LHC is performing admirably. Can’t say the same about the rest, though.’
Itaru|’This baby’s fickle as a cat, but it was surprisingly obedient this month. It would be great if it stayed like this forever.’
Itaru|’But don’t you think this work is unrewarding? This kitten -- this 27-kilometer long kitten, HAHAHAHA -- has been in operation for nine years.’
Itaru|’Our research will change the course of history, yet only a small group of people are allowed to see it.’
Itaru|’Of course, if it were ever officially released, it would be one hell of a scandal.’
Itaru|’People would probably say something like, ’Call Robert Zemeckiff to SERN right away. He could build it in less than a year.’’
Rintaro|...Nine years?
Rintaro|Do you think there were any translation errors in that email?
Itaru|If you trust the translation software, then that’s what it says. The Japanese is strange in places, though.
Rintaro|But that doesn’t make sense.
Rintaro|I thought the LHC was only put into operation around spring last year. But this email makes it sound like it’s been in operation for nine years.
Itaru|That is strange.
Rintaro|Keep looking, Daru. Search for anything related to time machine research.
Itaru|Seriously?
Itaru|Hmm, there aren’t any emails with the phrase ’time machine’ in them...
Itaru|But the phrase ’Z Program’ was used hundreds of times in the past few months.
Itaru|Do you think it could be about the current LHC experiments?
Rintaro|What is it specifically? Black hole formation experiments?
Itaru|Hmmm, let’s try looking for a document... ah, found one.
Itaru|Oho! Looks like this is top secret stuff from France, England, and Holland.
Rintaro|...Government secrets?
Itaru|SERN’s not even a government organization, so why?
Itaru|Wait, should we be looking at this stuff? We might be in a little deep here.
Rintaro|I don’t care. Get me details.
Itaru|Hold on. If we get caught, we’re not getting off with an apology.
Rintaro|Are you so incompetent as to let yourself be traced?
Itaru|...I took the necessary precautions.
Rintaro|Then I fail to see the problem.
Itaru|Well, thanks.
Itaru|Hmm... ’May 14th, 137th Z Program Experiment Report’...
Itaru|’Because we have already succeeded at creating mini black holes, the report is omitted. First--’
Rintaro|Stop! Stooopp!
Rintaro|So SERN did use the LHC to generate mini black holes!
Itaru|But they announced that their experiments still haven’t succeeded, so why...
Itaru|But the goal of the experiment wasn’t even to generate mini black holes. It was to create new elementary particle reactions...
Rintaro|But in reality, they’re already generating those mini black holes.
Itaru|Sure does seem like it.
Rintaro|What does it say next?
Itaru|Umm...
Itaru|’Results: Error. Human is dead, mismatch. For details, consult Jellyman’s Report No.14.’
Itaru|’We propose that further experiments be halted until the lifter is perfected and all local field conformity points are online.’
Rintaro|Wh-what does that mean?
Itaru|’Human is dead’ means somebody died, right?
Rintaro|Wha...
Rintaro|What is this Jellyman’s Report?
Itaru|I can’t find it in Jack’s email. We’ll need an account with more privileges.
Rintaro|Then we’ll save that for next time. Search for something related to time machines.
Itaru|You know we’re not going to find anything, right?
Itaru|Words like ’accelerator technical committee,’ and ’LHC project lead’ came up, so I guess we should look for an ID from there. Maybe then we can get more information.
Rintaro|You can’t look it up with the ID you have?
Rintaro|Well, I guess let’s call it a day.
Itaru|By the way, what we just saw was SERN’s biggest server, but I also found a strange database on the network.
Rintaro|Strange how?
Itaru|It was buggy.
Rintaro|Buggy?
Itaru|I mean, it was full of some kind of code...
Itaru|But the code was gibberish. Utterly impossible to decode, thank you very much.
Rintaro|Could it be encrypted?
Itaru|Not by any algorithm I’ve ever seen. It wouldn’t even work as a program. It just bothers me. Why would they have a database that nobody could ever use?
Rintaro|That is strange.
Itaru|I’ll see what I can find out.
Itaru|Agh! I don’t get it! I don’t get it at all!
Itaru|You call this a program, dumbass!? Go to hell!
Mayuri|I think you should stop...
Itaru|My head is spinning... I can’t take it any more... fweh, fweheh...
Rintaro|Good work. Go rest, Daru.
Itaru|Yeah... I’ll do that.
Itaru|Anyway, even if it isn’t a bug, but an actual program, only the guys who made it could understand it.
Itaru|I’ve never seen anything like it...
Rintaro|...!
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Heh heh heh... of course. Everything is falling into place.
Mayuri|Whatcha talking about?
Rintaro|John Titor... SERN... the time machine...
Rintaro|Daru, I think I know how we can read that program.
Itaru|Seriously? How?
Rintaro|If my hunch is correct, John Titor should know!
Itaru|What? There’s no way!
Rintaro|Say what you like. We’ll know soon enough.
Rintaro|It’s here!
Rintaro|Heh, heh heh heh... Just as I suspected.
Itaru|Huh?
Rintaro|I was right, Daru.
Rintaro|I know where that data comes from.
Itaru|An IBN 5100!
Suzuha|It can also decipher IBN’s proprietary programming language, which was written before APL and BASIC became widespread. Isn’t that surprising?
Suzuha|Now it’s a dead programming language only decipherable with an IBN 5100.
Rintaro|Heh heh heh. No... NO, I SAY! This discovery of ours was inevitable from the start! For this is the choice of Steins Gate!!
Itaru|Wait, so SERN has an IBN 5100 database? Those machines aren’t compatible with any modern software. Why would they do something like that?
Rintaro|Answer me this. What is the best way to secure a machine against external cracking?
Itaru|Well, make it standalone, of course.
Itaru|If only IBN 5100s can read it, then I guess that’s kind of standalone...
Rintaro|Which means that SERN’s keeping their most important secrets hidden there!
Itaru|How do you know about that hidden function anyway?
Rintaro|It is recorded in my brain’s extensive Index Librorum Prohibitorum.
Itaru|Very original.
Rintaro|Mayuri! We have important matters to discuss. Assemble!
Mayuri|Hm? I can hear you fine from here.
Rintaro|It doesn’t matter whether you can hear or not!
Rintaro|This meeting concerns the fate of the Future Gadget Laboratory -- nay, the fate of mankind!
Rintaro|So I want it to feel more secretive, like we’re scheming or something!
Mayuri|Mayushii won’t participate in your evil schemes.
Rintaro|Listen, you two! Henceforth, the Future Gadget Laboratory shall begin emergency top secret operations!
Rintaro|This shall be the first stage in our war against the dark powers that manipulate the world from the shadows! Our enemy is SERN, a scientific institute engaged in the most evil research imaginable!
Itaru|Okarin, you’re too loud... and I’ve been up all night.
Rintaro|Understand? The world has no need for two mad scientists. Before they can get ahead of us, we must outwit them!
Itaru|Who are they?
Rintaro|You know... them.
Mayuri|Um, Mayushii doesn’t get it at all...
Rintaro|Basically, we must obtain the phantom retro PC... the IBN 5100, said to be located somewhere in Akiba.
Itaru|I’ll pass on the search. I’m seriously tired. Besides, I want to keep combing SERN’s server.
Rintaro|That’s true...
Rintaro|Well, you’re the only one who can do that, Daru, so I’ll leave it to you.
Rintaro|So, the IBN 5100 investigation squad shall consist of Mayuri and me--
Mayuri|I can’t...
Mayuri|I have to make costumes, and I have work, too.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Fine. I’ll manage alone somehow. It’s useless to try and stop me. Understood?
Mayuri|Are you going to do something bad again?
Itaru|Nah, he’s all talk.
Suzuha|Hiya, Okabe Rintaro.
Rintaro|Pretty nice technique there.
Suzuha|Bicycles are fun, aren’t they? I’d never ridden one before coming here.
Rintaro|You’d never ridden a bicycle!?
Suzuha|Nope. I had ridden motorcycles before, though.
Rintaro|Going to work now?
Suzuha|Yup.
Rintaro|That’s perfect. There’s something we need to talk about.
Suzuha|Ehh? But I need to get the shop ready for business.
Rintaro|Just what does this crumbly old Braun Tube Workshop need to get ’ready’?
Suzuha|Nothing, really. Geez. I just mindlessly sweep in front of the shop. If I clean inside, the boss gets angry. ’Everything’s where it needs to be,’ he says.
Rintaro|So hear me out, then.
Suzuha|But I’m so tired.
Rintaro|You would be... unwise to anger me.
Suzuha|Does it have to be right now?
Suzuha|Then go ahead.
Suzuha|But keep it short, okay?
Rintaro|Where is the IBN 5100?
Suzuha|No intel yet.
Rintaro|What?
Suzuha|I don’t know.
Rintaro|But by the way you talked yesterday, it sure sounded like you knew.
Suzuha|No, I know someone who knows.
Rintaro|Then take me to them. I won’t take no for an answer. Refuse, and I’ll show you a living hell.
Suzuha|I can’t.
Suzuha|I can’t introduce you even if I wanted to.
Rintaro|What do you mean? Don’t tell me they’re an imaginary--
Suzuha|They’ve been dead for years.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|I’m sorry.
Suzuha|Nah, it’s okay. Anyway, there’s nothing I can tell you. Honestly, I’m hoping you can tell me something.
Tennouji|Hey, part-timer! It’s only your third day and you’re late!?
Suzuha|Sorry, boss! The streets were a little crowded this morning.
Tennouji|If you’re not gonna take this seriously, I can always give you the boot, hear?
Tennouji|As for you, Okabe, don’t you lay a finger on my part-timer.
Rintaro|Aren’t you the lecherous one here, Mister Braun?
Tennouji|Why you. Just try saying something like that in front of Nae. I’ll murder ya. Gotta keep my honor as a father.
Tennouji|Besides, I ain’t got no use for a skinny kid like her.
Suzuha|What was that!? Take that back, boss!
Tennouji|What, you mad?
Suzuha|I’m not a kid! I’m a warrior!
Tennouji|Hah? What’re you talking about?
Rintaro|I like the look in your eyes, you Part-Time Warrior. They shine with the radiance of the beast unseen in modern men.
Rintaro|Never forget those eyes of yours, and you shall surely change class from Part-Time Warrior... to True Warrior.
Suzuha|But I’m already a warrior!
Rintaro|Stay diligent in your training, and you shall have a place at my side on the field of Ragnarok.
Suzuha|Ragnarok?
Suzuha|What’s that?
Rintaro|The final battle against SERN.
Suzuha|You’ve got something like that planned? Count me in if you do, but I’ve never heard of it.
Rintaro|Of course you haven’t. This is the first time I’ve revealed it. For I shall be the one to initiate Ragnarok! And the world shall be reborn!
Suzuha|Wow! You sure are brave, Okabe Rintaro. You’ll probably fail, but I like your spirit.
Suzuha|I wish my comrades were as spirited as you are.
Tennouji|Why does my store attract nothing but weirdos? Damn.
Tennouji|Whatever, part-timer. Just come inside.
Suzuha|Coming!
Suzuha|Later, Okabe Rintaro!
Mayuri|Wait up, Okarin!
Rintaro|So you’re going to help me search after all? That’s the lab mem spirit.
Mayuri|Oh, no, that’s not it. I was thinking about buying lunch.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|So, where do you plan to go?
Mayuri|Hmmm, what to eat...
Mayuri|Sanbo’s beef bowl sounds good!
Rintaro|But Sanbo isn’t open this earl--
Mayuri|I feel like I can reach the stars.
Rintaro|It’s too early for stars, Mayuri.
Mayuri|Did you know? Even during the day, the stars are still up there.
Rintaro|Getting philosophical is nice and all, but it’s dangerous to stop in the middle of the street.
Mayuri|Ehehe! That’s true.
Mayuri|Oh, just now, when I was looking at the stars, I decided to have ramen for lunch today!
Kurisu|Ah.
Rintaro|Well, if it isn’t my assistant. What are you doing here?
Kurisu|Hey. When did I become your assistant?
Kurisu|...Why are you glaring at me?
Rintaro|Don’t worry about it. You’re not the cause of my frustration.
Kurisu|Oh, so you’re just raging? Don’t glare at me.
Rintaro|You’ve glared at me before, haven’t you?
Kurisu|That’s because you keep doing pervy--
Kurisu|Ah, no, I’m not saying anything.
Kurisu|Are the emails you’re getting really that unpleasant?
Rintaro|They’re more... unreasonable than unpleasant.
Rintaro|So, Christina, what brings you here?
Kurisu|If you’re going to call me names, could you at least be consistent?
Kurisu|Anyway, my business here doesn’t concern you.
Rintaro|Why are you pouting?
Kurisu|I’m not pouting. I just don’t want to get involved in your silly games again.
Rintaro|Nonsense. You’re already a lab mem. You have a duty to work for the benefit of the lab!
Kurisu|...I regret losing myself to curiosity back then.
Rintaro|Did you come to see the satellite?
Kurisu|...I guess.
Kurisu|It doesn’t make sense. Normally, they calculate satellites’ orbits so that they burn up in the atmosphere when they fall. So how can that thing be in such perfect condition?
Rintaro|Where’s this satellite from, anyway?
Kurisu|They still don’t know. Rumors say it’s from the former Soviet Union, but Russia denies it. So it looks like they can’t remove it yet.
Rintaro|So it’s another Organization cover-up! They knew I’d be at Radi-Kan and tried to erase me!
Kurisu|Organization? What’s that?
Rintaro|The Organization is the Organization. Its formal name is something else, but all those who know of its existence call it the Organization out of fear.
Rintaro|They rule the world from the shadows, transcending nations, with politics, economics, religion, even science in their clutches.
Kurisu|That’s obviously a crackpot conspiracy theory, thank you very mu--
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|What’s wrong?
Kurisu|N-nothing! Really, nothing, okay? Say another word and I hit you!
Kurisu|A-anyway! What’s happened with the PhoneWave!?
Rintaro|I thought you didn’t want to get involved. And it’s not the PhoneWave, it’s the PhoneWave (name subject to change)--
Kurisu|Just answer me. Have you learned anything?
Rintaro|No progress. We’ve tried repeating the experiment, but at present, we haven’t been able to reproduce the discharge phenomenon or send another email to the past.
Kurisu|I see...
Kurisu|Hello? Can you put your phone away when you’re talking with someone?
Rintaro|Don’t be like that. Rather, you should praise me, for I have taught a foul mail demon to behave like a civilized human being.
Kurisu|Why are you so pompous?
Rintaro|I’d ask you the same thing, Christina.
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|Are you done with your little mail exchange? Hououin-san?
Rintaro|Oh? So you remember my true name. Indeed, I am Hououin Kyouma.
Kurisu|I was being facetious.
Rintaro|How was that facetious? You called me by my correct name. You made no mistake. You’ll make a good assistant.
Kurisu|Okabe-san... have you sought professional help?
Rintaro|I am not Okabe!
Kurisu|This is exhausting...
Kurisu|You’re pompous, but at least you have some manners.
Rintaro|What do you mean?
Kurisu|I hate people who play with their phones in the middle of a conversation.
Rintaro|Ah, so that’s why you grabbed my phone when we first met.
Kurisu|When we first met? I didn’t do that.
Rintaro|Yeah you did. There I was, giving my report, when you grabbed my--
Kurisu|What? What do you mean ’giving your report’?
Rintaro|No. It’s nothing.
Rintaro|So, about the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Rintaro|After the experiment, you screamed something like ’A time machine? It can’t be!’ Did something awaken a past trauma?
Kurisu|No. And don’t go making one up either.
Rintaro|Back when she was five years old, Christina was on the plains of Arkansas when lightning--
Kurisu|I wasn’t hit by lightning! And I was still living in Japan when I was five! And why Arkansas?
Rintaro|I was trying to imagine tranquil scenery, and the first state to come to mind was Arkansas. Second was Oregon.
Kurisu|Not Utah? I mean, relatively speaking, isn’t Utah more suitable?
Rintaro|Then answer me, Christina! Why did you freak out back then!?
Kurisu|...No reason. I simply didn’t want to believe. Fringe science should stay in the realm of fiction.
Rintaro|Fringe science? Don’t be ridiculous.
Rintaro|You saw it with your own eyes. You saw the email leap to the past! You saw the banana travel instantly through space!
Kurisu|I saw... but we must be missing something. Or maybe we’re just seeing what we want to see.
Kurisu|Remember what I said at ATF? Time machines are just a pipe dream given modern technology.
Kurisu|And yet a bunch of amateurs like you just stick a phone and a microwave together and expect time travel to occur? Ridiculous.
Rintaro|But it did occur! Will you deny what you saw with your own eyes? Are you saying that theories trump reality? Then I hope you enjoy sophistry and word games, because that’s all you’ll ever have!
Kurisu|What do you mean, word games?
Rintaro|Quantum theory, for example. If you ask me, theories like that are nothing but word games!
Kurisu|Wait, are you rejecting modern physics? Who do you think you are?
Rintaro|Trust what you see! The only things that matter are things that happen; things that don’t happen, things that aren’t observed, are just hypotheses!
Kurisu|When hypotheses pile up, and theories are verified, they become reality.
Kurisu|That’s how modern physics comes to understand the truth of the universe.
Rintaro|But sometimes your hypotheses are mistaken! Even Einstein was wrong about some things!
Kurisu|So you’re going to do nothing, just because you could be wrong? Then enjoy your dirty little lab and your silly gadgets, because that’s all you’ll ever have.
Kurisu|You’ll never reach the truth that way. Failure teaches success.
Rintaro|I see. Nice rebuttal.
Kurisu|...You’re never getting off your high horse, are you?
Rintaro|By the way, Christina, I have always felt that physicists are hypocrites.
Kurisu|...What?
Rintaro|There are phenomena that everyone knows occur in reality, but which physicists refuse to research. What do you think about that?
Kurisu|I don’t know what to say unless you can give me some examples.
Rintaro|Ghosts, for instance.
Kurisu|The occult? Really?
Rintaro|You refuse to research it just because it’s the occult? That contradicts what you just said!
Rintaro|’You’ll never reach the truth that way!’
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|People have seen ghosts. There is even photographic evidence.
Rintaro|So where are the theories? Why do physicists refuse to speak?
Kurisu|...It’s a different field of study.
Rintaro|You can’t call physics the study of natural phenomena, then decide some things don’t count!
Kurisu|True, but...
Rintaro|And that’s why we must investigate the phenomenon of sending emails to the past. You shall assist me!
Kurisu|No.
Kurisu|I won’t have a hand in your fringe science. I won’t make the same mistake my father did.
Rintaro|Your father?
Kurisu|You make a fine argument, but it won’t work in the scientific community.
Kurisu|The day you decide to research time travel is the day you’re out of a job.
Rintaro|How can you be so certain?
Kurisu|Because that’s what happened to my father.
Kurisu|My father, a physicist, loved time machines. He was so fascinated by Wells’s ’The Time Machine’ that he seriously studied time travel.
Kurisu|But because of his obsession, he was practically exiled from the scientific community.
Kurisu|I will never get involved with time travel research!
Kurisu|...I’m sorry. I got emotional.
Rintaro|Muhahaha! Don’t worry about it! I wanted to test your character, so I made you angry on purpose!
Kurisu|...Huh?
Kurisu|...Anyway, the PhoneWave isn’t a time machine.
Kurisu|Email is a manmade system, so this phenomenon should be explainable in the scope of that system.
Rintaro|I understand. I had no idea you hate time machines that much. It’s almost like an allergy.
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|I apologize for forcing you to become a lab mem. You don’t have to come again.
Kurisu|...I wasn’t planning on it.
Rintaro|But know this, Christina.
Kurisu|Don’t call me Christina.
Rintaro|Lab Mem Number 004 will be a retired number. That number... is yours forever.
Kurisu|You look ridiculous!
Rintaro|What are you doing!? You’ve ruined my perfectly-staged exit scene! And you call yourself my assistant!?
Kurisu|No, I don’t call myself your assistant! And besides, I still have something to ask you!
Kurisu|I asked you about this before, but you said I got stabbed, right? I demand an explanation.
Rintaro|That was just something I hallucinated.
Kurisu|Why would you dream about me?
Rintaro|I don’t know. And it wasn’t a dream. It was a hallucination.
Kurisu|You said something about Doctor Nakabachi, didn’t you?
Rintaro|Doctor Nakabachi held a time machine presentation at Radi-Kan that day.
Kurisu|That presentation was canceled because of the satellite crash.
Rintaro|So it seems. But in my hallucination, the presentation proceeded as planned. Mayuri and I went to see it, and you came over to flirt with me.
Kurisu|I don’t flirt. Especially not with idiots like you.
Rintaro|Like I said, it wasn’t real, okay? No... maybe this world is what isn’t real.
Rintaro|That would explain the riddle of the PhoneWave (name subject to change). If this world is some kind of simulation, then we can disregard the laws of physics.
Kurisu|Escapism? That’s unexpectedly chicken of you.
Rintaro|It’s a hypothesis. Your favorite thing.
Kurisu|So who stabbed me? Don’t tell me it was you.
Rintaro|You were already dead when I got there. I didn’t see who did it.
Kurisu|I don’t get it. Why do I have to die in your mind? You have something against me?
Rintaro|Of course not. At that point in time, we had only spoken once. We were just strangers.
Rintaro|Anyway, we didn’t know each other. That’s why I ran away instead of calling for an ambulance.
Kurisu|My hero.
Rintaro|What? You want me to go back in time and give you CPR or something? I’d need to use the PhoneWave (name subject to change) for that.
Kurisu|...I’ve heard enough. No more hallucinating about me, okay? Dying isn’t fun, even if it’s in someone else’s head.
Rintaro|I can’t make any guarantees. That would require perfect 24-hour surveillance inside my brain.
Kurisu|You have a comeback for everything, don’t you.
Kurisu|Kyah! What now!?
Rintaro|I’m not done talking!
Kurisu|You trying to pick a fight?
Rintaro|It’s revenge for ruining my farewell scene, Christina! You shall regret your thoughtless actions!
Kurisu|Okay, okay, fine. What is it?
Rintaro|About the IBN 5100.
Kurisu|I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Rintaro|...If you don’t know, then forget about it. Farewell! We will not meet again.
Kurisu|Hey! Don’t tell me to forget about it!
Kurisu|What is the IBN five... whatever?
Rintaro|Then IBN 5100. It’s a retro PC from 1975. I’m looking for one.
Kurisu|Yeah? What are you going to do with it?
Rintaro|Interested?
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|You’re interested, aren’t you?
Kurisu|...Just a little.
Rintaro|Then I shall answer! The IBN 5100 is the key to unlocking SERN’s most closely guarded secrets.
Kurisu|SERN? You mean... the SERN?
Rintaro|Indeed. Through the tireless efforts of my faithful lab mems, we have uncovered evidence that SERN is researching time travel.
Kurisu|...Great. I shouldn’t have asked.
Rintaro|Hmmm...
Rintaro|It’s me. What’s up?
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Mayushii here.
Rintaro|I thought I told you not to contact me on this line. It could be tapped.
Mayuri|Huhwha?
Rintaro|I’m telling you to not be so careless. Anyway, give me a sitrep.
Mayuri|Um, Okarin? Mayushii doesn’t know what that means...
Rintaro|I’m asking why you’re calling.
Mayuri|Why didn’t you just say that?
Mayuri|Um, what are you doing now?
Rintaro|Executing the mission.
Mayuri|Executing the missus?
Rintaro|The mission! I’m looking for an IBN 5100!
Mayuri|Ehehe! Well why didn’t you say so? Mayushii heard something amazing just now.
Mayuri|Wanna hear?
Rintaro|If it’s valuable information, then by all means.
Mayuri|Well, then come to MayQueen! I’ll be waiting♪
Rintaro|Hey, tell me over the phone! Hey, Mayuri!
Rintaro|Why do I have to go all the way to MayQueen...
Mayuri|Okarin!
Mayuri|Mayushii went to the convenience store during lunch break.
Mayuri|Now there’s only five minutes left!
Rintaro|Good work. So, what was that amazing thing you heard?
Mayuri|Before that, food.
Rintaro|Let me have one.
Mayuri|Okay.
Mayuri|Here you go♪
Rintaro|You can’t do that in front of the store. You’re supposed to be a maid.
Mayuri|So?
Rintaro|Here, you’re not Shiina Mayuri, but Mayushii NyanNyan.
Rintaro|You can’t ’say aah’ in front of the store! Your customers are going to see that as an act of betrayal.
Mayuri|Oh! Mayushii didn’t think of that.
Rintaro|Well? What was that amazing thing you heard?
Mayuri|Oh, right! Actually, it’s about the IBN 5100.
Rintaro|You found a lead!? Of course, it was at MayQueen! I can’t believe I missed it!
Mayuri|No it’s not! That’s silly!
Mayuri|Mayushii was thinking of the IBN 5100 during work, so I asked the other girls if they knew anything.
Mayuri|First I asked Makki-chan, but Makki-chan said she’s not good with computers.
Mayuri|And then there’s LisaLisa-chan, but she only knows about the latest PCs. And she’s actually a Machead...
Rintaro|Just get to the point. I don’t really care how much trouble you went through.
Mayuri|Hm? Um, well, I think Feris-chan knows.
Rintaro|What!? Is that true!?
Mayuri|Yup. Did you know she’s a retro PC maniac?
Rintaro|Faris?
Rintaro|It’s me. Looks like we’ve got a lead on the IBN 5100. Are you ready for this? It’s Faris NyanNyan.
Rintaro|It turns out that catgirl’s an expert on retro PCs. There’s probably another side to this. Let’s keep our eyes peeled.
Rintaro|...Hmph. I suppose I’m the only man for the job. Very well. I’ll make the approach.
Rintaro|If you don’t hear from me by 2000 hours tonight, then forget about me and commence the strike on MayQueen.
Rintaro|Everything is the choice of Steins Gate... El Psy Kongroo.
Mayuri|Ahh! I didn’t say you could have two!
Rintaro|Well done, Mayuri! I’ll see that your information is put to good use!
Mayuri|My chicken...
Rintaro|By the way, what’s this Feris Cup about?
Mayuri|My chicken...
Rintaro|Well, whatever. I’m uneasy about the lack of intel, but the mission must go on.
Rintaro|Wait here, Mayuri. If I don’t return within the hour, go home immediately. Understood?
Mayuri|I can’t! I have to work.
Rintaro|...
Faris|Welcome, Myaster♪
Faris|Nyanya♪ Is Kyouma gonna join too?
Faris|Today’s the Faris Cup, nya!
Rintaro|It’s me. Run a search on the Faris Cup.
Rintaro|...What!? A battle to the death where the winner gets to use Faris however he pleases!?
Rintaro|Looks like I’ve stepped into one hell of a mess. ...No, there’s no problem. I’ll survive... by any means necessary. El Psy Kongroo.
Rintaro|The Faris Cup is a battle royale, isn’t it?
Faris|No, nya. It’s a cat-eat-cat battle royale where the winner gets to make Faris his slave, nya.
Rintaro|...
Faris|Ahh, no, you can’t! You can’t claw at each other’s throats over Faris, nya! Please, stop nya!
Faris|Kyouma, please, nya. Stop them.
Rintaro|Don’t worry. There’s nobody for me to stop. Everyone’s sitting silently in their seats.
Rintaro|No, seriously, what’s the Faris Cup?
Faris|A paw-to-paw contest with Faris nya. Faris goes at it with everyone at the same time nyan. A reward goes to those Faris finds worthy, nya.
Rintaro|Faris, are you serious!?
Faris|...If you don’t do something, Faris is gonna become everyone’s plaything, nya.
Faris|Save Faris’s fur, Kyouma...
Rintaro|I refuse!
Faris|NyaNya!?
Rintaro|I didn’t come to fight. I only came to talk to you.
Faris|If you’re not going to play, then I’m sorry, but I’ll have to ask you to leave, nya.
Rintaro|What’s this? A maid, sending a customer away?
Faris|Faris is the organyaizer of the Faris Cup today. Only participants are allowed inside the shop, nya.
Rintaro|I only need two minutes. The IBN--
Faris|Not listening, nyan!
Faris|If you want to talk to Faris, you have no choice but to join the Faris Cup, nyan.
Rintaro|...Now that’s just low.
Faris|So, what’ll it be nyan? You can’t survive unless you fight with your own paws, nyan!
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|There’s no choice. I accept your challenge. But on one condition.
Rintaro|If I face you, you’ll tell me everything you know!
Faris|NyaNya? Well, fine by me nya...
Faris|Well then, Master, this way, nyannyan♪
Itaru|Huh? Why are you here? You don’t do RaiNet.
Rintaro|Wha, Daru!?
Rintaro|What are you doing here!? What about SERN!?
Itaru|Let me rest for one day, man. You should treat me better after two consecutive all-nighters.
Rintaro|SERN’s power grows stronger by the day, and here you are without a care in the world.
Itaru|You’re here too.
Rintaro|I came here for an unrelated matter and got dragged into this nonsense. I’m not interested in RaiNet or Faris’s home cooking.
Rintaro|Daru, Operation Sigma.
Itaru|What’s that?
Rintaro|I’m saying we should cooperate. We’ll be the strongest if we team up, right?
Itaru|More like you’re gonna drag me down. You’re a noob at this game, Okarin.
Rintaro|But you’re my right-hand man. As long as we’re together, we have nothing to fear.
Itaru|But I refuse. I’m in this thing to win.
Rintaro|And you call yourself my friend!?
Itaru|In this tournament, we’re enemies.
Rintaro|You traitor! Why do you think I sent you into this cafe as a spy?
Itaru|But you didn’t send me. I’m Faris-tan’s biggest fan. I check her blog every day and--
Faris|Hi everyone♪ Thanks for waiting, nyan! The afternoon Faris Cup is about to begin nya!
Faris|Thank you, nya!
Faris|The rules are simple. Faris will face off against each one of you nya.
Faris|Faris will even go paw-to-paw with ten people at once, nyan.
Faris|If you beat Faris, you’ll get her home cooking as a reward, nya.
Faris|Now then, everyone! Enjoy the contest!
Itaru|Gwah... strong Faris is strong...
Faris|Nyahaha♪ I hope the next group tries a little harder nyan.
Mayuri|Feris-chan sure is strong.
Mayuri|Mayushii’s bad at RaiNet, so I’m really jealous.
Rintaro|What would you do if you were good at it?
Mayuri|Don’t you know? RaiNet AccessBattlers isn’t just popular in Akiba. It’s a global blend!
Rintaro|I think you mean trend.
Mayuri|Yeah, that. So if you get good at it, you’re sure to be every kid’s hero!
Rintaro|Hero, huh... That doesn’t sound bad.
Mayuri|Besides, Upa is so cute♪
Rintaro|Wait. There’s something strange about your argument. How does RaiNet skill relate to Upa’s cuteness?
Mayuri|Feris-chan’s too busy to go to tournaments, but I she’s definitely a world-class player.
Faris|NyanNyan. Sorry, nya, but Faris never pulls punches in RaiNet.
Faris|I want someone who can go paw-to-paw with me, nyan.
Itaru|Gwohh! Feris-tan is too strong! We can’t win. It was hopeless from the get-go!
Rintaro|Hmph! You’re all pathetic.
Rintaro|But we’ve been saving the best for last.
Rintaro|Daru! Allow me to show you... how a true man fights.
Itaru|Don’t tell me you’ve got a plan?
Rintaro|Hmph. Indeed I do. Let’s just call this Operation ’Sweet Side’.
Faris|So Kyouma thinks he’s up to par, nya?
Rintaro|The tears of the fallen twenty... shall not be in vain.
Rintaro|Do you remember our promise, Faris? Once this match is over, you’ll tell me everything you know.
Itaru|Amazing! That crazy bastard actually means to win!
Mayuri|Go for it, Okarin♪
Rintaro|Five minutes. That’s all it will take to decide the match.
Faris|Okay! Round 3, start nya♪ RaiNet AccesssBattlers, duel access!
Rintaro|I give up.
Itaru|You’re weak! Too weak!
Mayuri|Mayushii’s disappointed...
Itaru|So it was all a bluff!? What happened to Operation ’Sweet Side’!?
Faris|It was almost like Kyouma committed suicide, nya.
Itaru|Wait, don’t tell me...
Rintaro|Muhahaha! Yes! It’s exactly what you’re thinking!
Rintaro|Operation Sweet Side was a suicide attack!
Itaru|That’s gotta be the worst pun ever!
Faris|But why are you so proud even though I made kitty litter outta you, nya?
Rintaro|Heh heh heh. Have you not figured it out, Faris NyanNyan!? Win or lose, it made no difference.
Faris|What’s that supposed to mean, nya?
Rintaro|Do you remember the conditions I set?
Faris|Mya? If Faris lost, then she’d tell you everything--
Rintaro|No! You are wrong, Faris. What I said was...
Rintaro|’If I face you, you’ll tell me everything you know!’ If I face you. Now do you understand?
Rintaro|I never needed to win!
Rintaro|No one else could have pulled it off. These fools were lured here by the prospect of Faris’s home cooking. They were obsessed with winning.
Rintaro|But not I! Your home cooking meant nothing to me! That difference in motivation is what allowed this suicide mission to succeed!
Rintaro|Heh heh heh, muhahahaha, MUHAHAHAHAHA!
Mayuri|Wow, Okarin! You’re amazing!
Itaru|Th-that’s dirty...
Rintaro|I think you mean fiendishly clever! Behold the success of Operation Sweet Side!
Rintaro|Now, Faris. Answer me. Where is the IBN 5100!?
Faris|Nya? The IBN 5100?
Rintaro|Don’t play dumb. I have a reliable source.
Rintaro|I know that you have information on the IBN 5100.
Faris|Nya... how do you expect me to remember that, nya? Though I think I’ve seen this computer before...
Rintaro|What!? I thought you were an expert on retro PCs! Mayuri told me so!
Itaru|Uh, you leaked your source...
Mayuri|Yup! Mayushii’s a reliable source!
Faris|I’m not an expert, nya. Papa collected them, so we’ve got tons at home, that’s all.
Rintaro|So that must be where the IBN 5100 is sealed! Take me there at once!
Faris|I can’t, nyan.
Rintaro|What!? Why!?
Faris|Because that’s the Faris Clan’s sanctuary.
Faris|The only ones who may enter are the Faris Clan’s cat-eared daughters: those who purrsue the knowledge of the meow miko.
Faris|In other words, it’s paws-off to everybody but Faris, nya. Try to force your way in... and you’ll grow dog ears, nya!
Rintaro|Like hell I will! Dog ears!? Yeah right!
Faris|I-it’s true, nya... Faris doesn’t tell tall tails, nya...
Rintaro|You coward! You’ve converted your believers into your personal army!
Faris|Faris is only telling the truth, nya...
Rintaro|Gwaahhh!
Rintaro|No, n-not now... it’s too soon!
Faris|No! Don’t tell me! Is the Anti-RaiNet System activating!? I warned you playing RaiNet could kill you!
Rintaro|Damn, empty handed...
Mayuri|Okarin!
Rintaro|What happened? Is the Faris Cup already over?
Mayuri|Nope. Well, just about. After this, the customers get to chat with Feris-chan.
Mayuri|I wanted to tell you about that IBN 5100 thing. I showed Feris-chan the picture again.
Rintaro|Good work, Mayuri! Completely different from a certain useless super hacka! So?
Mayuri|Feris-chan said it was probably around the time she was in elementary school.
Mayuri|On a cold autumn day, while Feris-chan was shivering from the cold, her butler Kuroki-san came to help--
Rintaro|I don’t care about her butler! Just get to the point!
Mayuri|So basically, she ended up donating one of her dad’s computers to a shrine. She says it looked just like the one you’re looking for.
Rintaro|Donated it... to a shrine?
Rintaro|Which shrine?
Mayuri|Dunno. Where could it be?
Rintaro|Whatever. It’s a lead.
Rintaro|Good work, Mayuri. Continue your espionage mission.
Mayuri|SPN hodge?
Rintaro|Whatever, it doesn’t matter. Bye.
Mayuri|Okay! Bye bye♪
Rintaro|Shining Finger!
Rintaro|Finger!
Rintaro|Can’t you hear me?
Moeka|...Who?
Rintaro|Hououin Kyouma! The mad scientist.
Moeka|...Who?
Rintaro|What? Can’t you even remember people’s faces?
Rintaro|I agreed to help you find an IBN 5100, remember? And this is the thanks I get?
Moeka|Okabe-kun...
Rintaro|It’s Hououin.
Moeka|...
Moeka|Sent... email.
Rintaro|Email?
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|I suppose it is quite a coincidence. Were you looking through the parts stores too?
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Why won’t you speak!?
Moeka|...too hard.
Rintaro|Isn’t it harder to type everything out!?
Moeka|...
Moeka|Ah, Okabe-kun...
Rintaro|Want one?
Rintaro|Why don’t you talk?
Moeka|Emailing... is easier.
Rintaro|Of course. So that’s what it is!
Moeka|I’m... weird, aren’t I...
Rintaro|No, you’re normal.
Moeka|Really...?
Rintaro|You have nothing to be ashamed of. In this world, there exists something called absolute eternal truth. It’s a wall, immovable no matter how much you struggle.
Rintaro|That’s why people give up, abandon their dreams, choose a different path.
Rintaro|But never forget this one thing. You hold within your heart your own Steins Gate.
Moeka|Steins Gate...
Rintaro|All people, without exception, possess their own Steins Gate. As long as you have yours, you may follow any path without losing your way... just as I follow mine.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|So, on to business. Do you have any information on the IBN 5100?
Rintaro|How long have you been searching?
Moeka|...About two months.
Rintaro|Where have you looked?
Rintaro|Have you tried talking to PC store employees? They’d know more than anyone else.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|So what’s your actual goal? To obtain an IBN 5100, or to investigate the urban legend?
Moeka|Both.
Rintaro|I see.
Rintaro|Where do you plan to search next?
Moeka|That’s...
Moeka|I’m...
Rintaro|Hm? I didn’t quite hear you.
Rintaro|Don’t worry. I have a network of informants at my disposal. Finding a retro PC should be no trouble at all.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Have you forgotten who I am? Hououin Kyouma! I will stop at nothing to destroy the System and usher in a new era of chaos! Muhahaha!
Moeka|That’s... Okabe-kun’s Steins Gate...
Rintaro|Not Okabe! Hououin!
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Mayushii here.
Rintaro|It’s me. What’s the situation?
Mayuri|Okarin!
Mayuri|I just called you!
Rintaro|Yeah. Did something happen?
Mayuri|Actually, try calling Daru-kun.
Rintaro|What? Why?
Mayuri|Daru-kun’s at MayQueen right now. You should call him. He’ll tell you.
Mayuri|Bye bye!
Rintaro|Wait! Hey, Mayuri! Hey!
Rintaro|...
Itaru|What’s up?
Rintaro|It’s me. Report the situation.
Itaru|Okarin? You’re the only one who talks like that. Did you hear from Mayu-shi?
Rintaro|No, she didn’t tell me anything.
Itaru|Well, I’m at MayQueen right now.
Itaru|Mayu-shi did some investigating. Sounds like Faris-tan knows about the IBN 5100.
Rintaro|What!? Faris!?
Itaru|I understand your confusion, but apparently there are a lot of retro PCs at her home.
Rintaro|This too is the choice of Steins Gate!
Itaru|I don’t get you.
Rintaro|So, is Faris there?
Itaru|Of course. Today’s the Faris Cup.
Itaru|When I showed Faris-tan an image of the IBN 5100, she said she donated a similar PC to a shrine ten years ago. Dunno if it’s the one we want, though.
Rintaro|She donated it... to a shrine?
Rintaro|Which shrine?
Itaru|Uh, didn’t ask. My bad.
Rintaro|Whatever. It’s a lead.
Itaru|Well, I’m hanging up. The Faris Cup is about to begin.
Rintaro|I see. Daru, I’m sure you can do it. Be sure to win.
Itaru|Leave it to me!
Rintaro|Who is this?
???|...
Rintaro|You’re from the Organization, aren’t you? Is this a warning? You telling me to stop getting involved with SERN?
???|Huh?
Rintaro|You’re not from the Organization?
???|...No. It’s Makise.
Rintaro|Makise...
Rintaro|Sorry, but I don’t remember. Tell me where we met. Paris? Or London, perh--
Woman Named Makise|Akihabara. We saw each other yesterday, remember?
Rintaro|Oh! My assistant!
Kurisu|Not your assistant! Makise Kurisu!
Rintaro|If you don’t say Christina, then I have no way of knowing it’s you.
Kurisu|I’m not Christina either! How many times do I have to tell you?
Rintaro|You never stop complaining, do you?
Kurisu|Whose fault is that? Whose?
Rintaro|Wait a minute. How do you know my phone number?
Kurisu|Hashida-san told me.
Rintaro|Oh, that’s boring. So, what is it, assistant?
Kurisu|I said I’m not your assistant.
Kurisu|Haah, what’s the point... Where are you now?
Rintaro|I’m headed to Yanabayashi Shrine.
Kurisu|Ah, okay. Bye then.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Huh? What!? What was that!? Is she messing with me!? She’s messing with me!
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|Your accomplishments mean nothing to me.
Kurisu|What are you talking about?
Rintaro|What was that phone call about?
Kurisu|I just wanted to ask you where you were. And since you said you were coming here, I came.
Rintaro|Nobody asked you to come.
Kurisu|And yet, here I am.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|Why did you come to see me?
Kurisu|Not because I wanted to or anything. Don’t get me wrong.
Kurisu|...I can’t stop thinking about what you said yesterday.
Rintaro|What I said?
Kurisu|About the IBN 5100. And SERN.
Rintaro|Of course! You’re working for SERN, not the Organization! You’re here to kill me, aren’t you!? That’s what I thought! You have the face of a killer!
Kurisu|What’s wrong with my face? How rude!
Kurisu|Can you calm down a bit? You’re always screwing around. I can’t believe you’re older than me.
Rintaro|Calm down? Hmph! You don’t understand what it’s like to live on the run, never knowing when the next assassin will strike.
Kurisu|All I’m hearing is gibberish.
Rintaro|You come here to pick a fight?
Kurisu|I just want to know how the IBN 5100 and SERN are related.
Rintaro|Don’t you mean you’re interested in SERN’s time machine research? Be honest with yourself.
Kurisu|Sh-shut up. I’m not interested in time machines at all.
Kurisu|More importantly, did you find an IBN 5100?
Rintaro|That’s why I’m here.
Kurisu|A shrine?
Rintaro|Correct.
Luka|Ah, Oka... Kyouma-san, hello.
Rintaro|...Lukako, why don’t you have it?
Luka|Huh? Um, are you talking about Demon Sword Samidare?
Rintaro|I thought I told you to carry it at all times!
Luka|I’m sorry, but, it gets in the way when I’m cleaning, so...
Rintaro|What if they attack while you’re cleaning? Nobody’s going to come to your rescue, you know.
Luka|Th-that’s true... I’ll be more careful from now on.
Kurisu|Hey. What are you two talking about?
Luka|Um... who might this be?
Rintaro|My assistant.
Kurisu|No! What kind of introduction is that!?
Rintaro|I’m only telling the truth, Christina.
Luka|You’re n-not Japanese?
Kurisu|I am Japanese.
Rintaro|Anyway, Lukako. I need to talk to your father about--
Kurisu|Wait! Introduce me properly!
Rintaro|You want to be introduced? Properly?
Kurisu|It’s unnatural not to be introduced in this situation!
Rintaro|I didn’t come here to introduce you to Lukako!
Kurisu|An introduction wouldn’t take more than ten seconds! What’s wrong with you?
Luka|Um... please don’t fight...
Rintaro|This is Makise Kurisu. My assistant.
Kurisu|Yeah, whatever. Assistant, whatever... sigh.
Luka|Nice to meet you, Makise-san. I’m Urushibara L-Luka.
Kurisu|Nice to meet you too. How old are you?
Luka|17 this year.
Kurisu|A year younger than me...
Luka|Oh, really? Makise-san, you’re so grown up, I can’t believe we’re only a year apart.
Rintaro|That means you look old.
Kurisu|...
Luka|No, that’s not what I... um, I mean you’re very beautiful!
Kurisu|Thanks. I think you’re very cute.
Rintaro|You’re introduced. Happy? Can we move on now?
Kurisu|You are such a jerk.
Rintaro|Anyway, Lukako, I require an audience with your father. Can you make it happen?
Luka|Yes, sure, but why do you need to talk to my dad?
Rintaro|It’s a grave matter that concerns the future of mankind.
Luka|The future...
Kurisu|Of mankind?
Luka|I’ll go get him!
Kurisu|Achoo!
Kurisu|Oh no, did I catch a cold?
Luka|Hurry, Dad! Hurry!
Luka’s Father|Slow down a little. If you rush me, I’m going to fall.
Luka|But the future of mankind is at stake!
Luka’s Father|Oh. Well. That’s certainly serious.
Luka’s Father|Ah, Hououin-kun. It’s been a while. Thank you for always taking care of Luka.
Rintaro|The honor is mine.
Kurisu|...His name isn’t Hououin. It’s Okabe.
Luka’s Father|Oh. Really?
Rintaro|You there, assistant! Stop making things complicated!
Kurisu|I’m just telling the truth.
Luka’s Father|Luka told me his name was Hououin. Hmm, maybe Luka was just playing a trick on me. Hahaha.
Luka|Th-that’s not it, Dad. Okabe-san is his real name, and Hououin is, umm...
Rintaro|I am Hououin.
Kurisu|Okabe Rintaro is the name your parents gave you, right? Are you denying that?
Rintaro|Just be quiet, Zombie!
Kurisu|Who’s a zombie!?
Luka’s Father|Hahaha. It’s great that you all get along.
Luka’s Father|Are you one of Luka’s friends too? Please get along with Luka from now on too.
Kurisu|Um, I’m...
Luka’s Father|As you can see, this child of mine is so delicate.
Luka|C-come on, Dad...
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|...
Luka’s Father|So, Hououin-kun. Did you need me for something?
Luka’s Father|I don’t know if ’donated’ is the right word to use...
Luka’s Father|But an old computer was entrusted to this shrine about nine years ago.
Rintaro|Eh...
Rintaro|That’s it! That has to be it!
Luka’s Father|Please wait here. I’ll go get it.
Luka’s Father|Whew, it was hard to dig out. I think this is what you’re looking for.
Rintaro|An IBN 5100...!
Luka|Ah, look at this.
Rintaro|Muhahaha! MUHAHAHAHA! Finally, I have solved Akiba’s urban legend!
Rintaro|Urushibara-shi. I’ll be blunt.
Rintaro|May I borrow this computer?
Luka’s Father|Sure.
Rintaro|Seriously!?
Luka’s Father|When this was entrusted to us, the owner said this.
Luka’s Father|’If a young man ever appears and says that he needs this computer no matter what, please lend it to him with my blessings.’
Luka’s Father|I didn’t think it would actually happen. To be honest, I’d forgotten about it entirely until you reminded me.
Luka’s Father|I’m happy to lend it to you, Hououin-kun. But please be sure to return it when you’re done, okay?
Rintaro|Of course! Thank you!
Rintaro|Can’t Americans start driving at 16? How come you don’t have a license?
Kurisu|What, something wrong with that? I spend all my time doing research.
Rintaro|You’re wasting your youth.
Kurisu|I thought so too, until I met you. Now I realize I’m doing just fine.
Luka|Umm, no fighting please...
Rintaro|You’re a lifesaver, Lukako. Thank your father again for me.
Kurisu|Your father is a lovely man.
Luka|Eh...
Luka|M-my father is m-married... a-ad-adultery... is bad!
Kurisu|Huh?
Rintaro|I see, assistant. So you like older men.
Kurisu|Hey, wait! Don’t misunderstand, you two. That’s not what I meant!
Luka|I-I won’t give up my father...
Kurisu|P-please don’t cry...
Kurisu|I just meant I was jealous of how well you get along with your father. That’s all.
Luka|Eh, ah, of course... I’m sorry for the weird misunderstanding! That was so rude of me!
Kurisu|Don’t cry. We’ve resolved the misunderstanding, so it’s all okay.
Rintaro|...but in the depths of your heart lie feelings for Luka’s dad.
Kurisu|Die.
Rintaro|Lukako, don’t forget your practice swings with Samidare.
Luka|Y-yes sir. I’ll do my best... Umm, El Psy Kongalee...
Rintaro|It’s Kongroo! Don’t forget it.
Luka|I’m sorry!
Kurisu|Hey! What kind of lowlife teases a girl?
Rintaro|Hng! ...Gah, it’s heavy!
Luka|Is it that heavy?
Kurisu|Pathetic. It’s only as big as a CRT monitor.
Rintaro|Then why don’t you try carrying it? Then you’ll understand.
Kurisu|Wheugh...!
Kurisu|...It’s r-really heavy.
Kurisu|This thing’s gotta weigh like 30 kilos.
Kurisu|Maybe we should’ve borrowed a push cart. Urushibara-san, is there one in the shrine?
Luka|Umm, there is one, but actually, it’s broken... I’m sorry.
Kurisu|Oh. Is there some other place we could borrow--
Rintaro|No, we don’t need a push cart.
Kurisu|Then how are you going to bring it back? It takes about ten minutes to walk to your run-down lab from here.
Rintaro|It may be too heavy for one person, but it’s a different story for two. You and I just need to carry it together. Why else do you think I made you my assistant?
Kurisu|So that’s why...
Kurisu|Well, if we carry it together, we might be able to manage, but...
Kurisu|But I refuse.
Rintaro|...huh?
Kurisu|I... I said ’no!’ 
Rintaro|I’m pretty sure you said ’but I refuse.’
Kurisu|Sh-shut up. I said no.
Kurisu|The whole reason you made me a lab mem was to ’borrow my knowledge’. From this, it is elementary to derive the following: ’I won’t do physical labor.’
Rintaro|I see. Then I guess I have no choice. I’ll do my best to carry it, but...
Luka|Um, th-then, I will...
Kurisu|Eh? You’re going to help? Will you be okay?
Luka|Yes, I’ll d-do my best.
Rintaro|No, Lukako. I shouldn’t make you help me. I can manage by myself.
Luka|But... we’re friends, Okabe-san. I want to help you.
Rintaro|No, I’ll do it myself.
Luka|I-I’ll help you!
Kurisu|Th-then, umm... me too...
Rintaro|Please, go ahead.
Kurisu|Eh? Wha!?
Rintaro|Muhahaha! Don’t you know, Christina? This is what you call a Japanese Gag!
Kurisu|You sneaky...
Rintaro|Thanks for the backup, Lukako! Now that that’s settled, my assistant will help me carry the computer, so you don’t have to help. Thanks for the offer.
Luka|Ah, okay... if that’s how it is, then...
Rintaro|Now, assistant! Since you volunteered, I won’t let you refuse. Grab hold and heave!
Kurisu|...Fine.
Kurisu|Why do we have to be face to face?
Rintaro|Let’s just go.
Kurisu|Hey! Stop stop stop! I said stop!
Rintaro|You’re a noisy one.
Kurisu|Don’t walk forwards. Then I have to walk backwards. Let’s walk sideways.
Rintaro|Whatever. Get moving, assistant.
Kurisu|Hey, listen, please, just listen! I can’t walk backwards!
Rintaro|Of course you can. You’re my assistant.
Kurisu|I appreciate the vote of confidence, but I can’t! I’m asking you to go sideways! No, I’m telling you to go sideways! Sideways! I’m going to fall!
Kurisu|Haah, we finally made it... I’m exhausted...
Rintaro|If you didn’t complain so much about every little thing, we would’ve gotten here sooner.
Kurisu|Right back at you. You stopped to take a break at least five times along the way.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|That’s because I wasn’t feeling well...
Kurisu|Are you okay?
Rintaro|It’s just... occasionally, my right arm aches... and when it does, dark destructive impulses overcome my soul--
Kurisu|Shut up, or I’ll tear the peripheral nerves out of that arm.
Kurisu|Shouldn’t you get your friends to help?
Rintaro|You’re right.
Suzuha|Huh?
Suzuha|If it isn’t Okabe Rintaro. What’cha got there?
Rintaro|Hmph, you want to know? Then I’ll tell you!
Kurisu|Wait! If you’re just going to stand and talk, shouldn’t we put the box down first?
Rintaro|Y-yeah... actually, wait, this will only take a second.
Suzuha|Well? What is it?
Rintaro|What if I told you... it’s an IBN 5100?
Suzuha|No way! You found it!? Wow! Way to go, Okabe Rintaro!
Suzuha|Where was it?
Kurisu|Ugh, it’s heavy...
Rintaro|Let’s put it down!
Kurisu|Haah...
Suzuha|So, where was it?
Rintaro|Yanabayashi Shrine.
Suzuha|Yanabayashi Shrine? You mean like a Shinto shrine?
Rintaro|Yeah.
Suzuha|Why was it there...
Suzuha|Ah...!
Kurisu|Y-yes?
Suzuha|Makise Kurisu?
Kurisu|Yes...?
Suzuha|...
Kurisu|What is it? Have I done something wrong?
Suzuha|...Hmph.
Kurisu|Who was that?
Rintaro|She works part-time at that store.
Kurisu|Why was she glaring at me?
Rintaro|How should I know? Did you do something to make her angry?
Kurisu|I’ve never seen her before in my life. How rude.
Rintaro|Good work, everyone. With this, we can fight.
Kurisu|Who are you fighting?
Rintaro|SERN, and the system that rules the world.
Kurisu|If that’s what makes you happy...
Rintaro|Happy? I do not desire happiness. Have you forgotten? I am an insane mad scientist!
Rintaro|What I desire is chaos. The time machine exists to bring chaos to the world. MUHAHAHAHA!
Kurisu|Never mind happiness. You’re like a junkie hypersecreting beta endorphins.
Mayuri|Okarin? I don’t want you doing bad things, remember?
Itaru|But wow! I can’t believe you found one. You make the impossible look easy! That’s why we love you! That’s why we ad--
Kurisu|I certainly don’t admire him.
Itaru|...Eh?
Rintaro|Eh?
Kurisu|Eh...?
Mayuri|It’s all thanks to Mayushii!
Mayuri|Without Mayushii’s info, Okarin would still be lost on the streets of Akiba.
Rintaro|Mayuri’s right. She did well this time.
Mayuri|Ehehe! Anyway, it’s time for Mayushii to go home.
Mayuri|What about you, Chris-chan? Wanna go together?
Kurisu|Thanks. But I’m going to stay here a little longer.
Mayuri|Okay. But you should go home before it gets too late.
Mayuri|See you tomorrow! Tutturu♪ 
Rintaro|Now then, Daru. When do you think we can use the IBN 5100 to hack SERN?
Itaru|Hmm... well...
Itaru|Wow, it actually turned on.
Itaru|First I need to learn how to use this thing. It looks like hooking it up is gonna be a pain.
Itaru|It might take a while. I can’t play with this thing and search for the server admin’s ID at the same time.
Rintaro|Alright. Prioritize the ID search.
Rintaro|If possible, I’d like you to get the IBN 5100 ready to use this month, though.
Itaru|There’s still 30 days left this month. It’s not gonna take that long.
Rintaro|...?
Rintaro|I’m wise to your tricks, fiend!
Luka|Ah, Oka... Kyouma-san, hello.
Rintaro|...Lukako, why don’t you have it?
Luka|Huh? Um, are you talking about Demon Sword Samidare?
Rintaro|I thought I told you to carry it at all times!
Luka|I’m sorry, but it gets in the way when I’m cleaning...
Rintaro|What are you going to do if they attack while you’re cleaning? Nobody’s going to come to your rescue, you know.
Luka|Th-that’s true... I’ll be more careful from now on.
Rintaro|By the way, Lukako. I need to talk to your father. Can you go get him?
Luka|Yes, I can, but, what do you need to talk to him about?
Rintaro|Serious business, critical for the future of mankind.
Luka|The future... of mankind!?
Luka|I-I’ll go get him!
Luka|Hurry, dad! Hurry!
Luka’s Father|Slow down a little. If you rush me, I’m going to fall.
Luka|But the future of mankind is at stake!
Luka’s Father|Oh. Well. That’s certainly serious.
Luka’s Father|Ah, Hououin-kun. It’s been a while. Thank you for always taking care of Luka.
Rintaro|The honor is mine.
Luka’s Father|Did you need me for something?
Luka|Th-that’s right...! The future of mankind...!
Luka’s Father|That sounds serious.
Luka’s Father|I don’t know if ’donated’ is the right word to use...
Luka’s Father|But an old computer was entrusted to this shrine about nine years ago.
Rintaro|Eh...
Rintaro|That’s it! That has to be it!
Luka’s Father|Please wait here. I’ll go get it.
Luka’s Father|Whew, it was hard to dig out. I think this is what you’re looking for.
Rintaro|An IBN 5100...!
Luka|Ah, look at this.
Rintaro|Muhaha! MUHAHAHA! Finally, I have solved Akiba’s urban legend!
Rintaro|Urushibara-shi. I’ll be blunt.
Rintaro|May I borrow this computer?
Luka’s Father|Sure.
Rintaro|Seriously!?

Luka’s Father|I didn’t think it would actually happen. To be honest, I’d forgotten about it entirely until you reminded me.
Luka’s Father|I’m happy to lend it to you, Hououin-kun. But please be sure to return it when you’re done, okay?
Rintaro|Of course! Thank you!
Rintaro|So that means I have to carry it back.
Luka|It looks pretty heavy...
Rintaro|Hmph. No matter how heavy it may look, it’s still just a computer. I can manage.
Rintaro|Huff! ...Gah, it’s heavy!
Luka|A-are you okay?
Rintaro|Kuh... why now!?
Rintaro|My right hand... is aching!
Luka|B-but, that means...!
Luka|Umm, umm, I-I’ll perform an exorcism!
Rintaro|Wait... d-don’t go... I’m still okay...
Luka|B-but Kyouma-san, you look like you’re in pain! Wh-what should I do...
Rintaro|It’s okay... it’ll stop soon... you don’t need to worry...
Rintaro|But... I have a request. Will you hear me out?
Luka|Y-yes, if it’s something I can do!
Rintaro|Please help me... carry this box.
Luka|Eh...
Luka|B-but I’m not strong at all...
Rintaro|We can manage... together. You’re the only one I can depend on now.
Luka|Kyouma-san...
Luka|I don’t know if I can do it...
Rintaro|You can do it. I know you can.
Luka|...Okay. But, um, if we can take breaks along the way, I’d be happy...
Rintaro|Alright, Lukako, grab the other side.
Luka|Um... is your arm... okay now?
Rintaro|No. We can’t let our guard down. This might only be temporary.
Rintaro|We need to get this to the lab before I have a relapse.
Luka|I’ll do my best! But I’m not confident...
Rintaro|Don’t worry. I’ll support you.
Luka|Ugh! I-it’s heavy!
Rintaro|Brace your legs! Let’s keep going. We’ll move sideways, okay? Don’t move forwards or backwards!
Luka|Kayyy... Um, sideways, as in left? Right!?
Rintaro|Right... no, my right, so your left... go left!
Luka|Okaayyyyy...
Luka|B-but, my hand, my hand is cramping...
Rintaro|Fight, Lukako! And whatever you do, don’t drop it! We’re screwed if it breaks!
Luka|Ugh, ugghhh...
Luka|Haah... haah... we made it...
Rintaro|Yeah... thanks for the help... you’re... a lifesaver...
Rintaro|Phew, really... thanks...
Luka|Ah, no...
Luka|Since you’re my master, Kyouma-san, I’m happy... to be of use to you.
Rintaro|Come forth, my servants! By the covenant I command thee, grant me thy power!
Luka|K-Kyouma-san!?
Kurisu|You’re so annoying! What is it!?
Rintaro|Huh, I summoned an assistant. What are you doing here?
Kurisu|Who’re you calling an assistant? You wouldn’t pick up your phone, so I’ve been waiting here an hour for you.
Mayuri|Hi, Okarin! Huh? Luka-kun’s with you!
Suzuha|Hey, Okabe Rintaro. The boss says to quiet down. You’re disturbing the neighbors.
Rintaro|Assemble, servants! We have a mission of the utmost secrecy! Come!
Mayuri|What’s this?
Suzuha|Wait... you got one?
Rintaro|Indeed I did.
Suzuha|No way! Amazing! Way to go, Okabe Rintaro! Where did you find it?
Rintaro|Yanabayashi Shrine.
Suzuha|Yanbayashi Shrine? You mean, like a Shinto shrine?
Rintaro|Yeah.
Suzuha|What was it doing there...
Mayuri|Oh! So that’s why Luka-kun’s with you.
Luka|Y-yeah...
Kurisu|What’s this? What’re you talking about?
Luka|Um, the IBN... two thousand... five thousand... what was it?
Rintaro|I got an IBN 5100.
Kurisu|Oh, that thing you were talking about yesterday.
Suzuha|Ah...!
Kurisu|Y-yes?
Suzuha|Makise Kurisu?
Kurisu|Yes...?
Suzuha|...
Kurisu|What is it? Have I done something to you?
Suzuha|...Hmph.
Kurisu|Who was that?
Mayuri|Oh, she works part-time at the Braun Tube Workshop. Her name’s Suzu-san!
Rintaro|I know.
Mayuri|You do?
Kurisu|Why was she glaring at me like that?
Rintaro|How should I know? Did you do something to make her angry?
Kurisu|I’ve never seen her before in my life. How rude.
Rintaro|Anyway, help me out here. We’re taking this thing into the lab.
Rintaro|Hey! Why didn’t you help!?
Itaru|Well, you didn’t call me.
Rintaro|I said all members assemble, didn’t I!?
Kurisu|Haah, haah... why do I... have to...
Mayuri|So tired...
Luka|I can’t walk any more...
Rintaro|Good work, you three.
Rintaro|This is my thanks for helping. Eat up.
Luka|Thank you! I’m so happy!
Mayuri|But those are Mayushii’s bananas...
Rintaro|That reminds me, Mayuri. It’s thanks to you that I got this IBN 5100. If it weren’t for your information, it would’ve taken forever to find it.
Mayuri|Ehehe! Really? I’m glad I was useful.
Kurisu|What are you going to use the IBN 5100 for? Yesterday you said something about SERN.
Rintaro|You interested, Christina?
Kurisu|I’m not Christina, and I’m not interested. If you don’t want to tell me, then I don’t really care.
Rintaro|This artifact is needed for the war against SERN.
Kurisu|War? SERN’s a research institution.
Rintaro|Ostensibly, yes.
Kurisu|...What are you trying to do? Depending on the situation, I could turn you over to the police, you know?
Rintaro|Hmph, the police? Do you really think a mad scientist like me is afraid of the police? I’ve spent my life on the run from the Organization, a more fearsome enemy than you can possibly imagine.
Kurisu|You can’t be serious. Tell me what you’re trying to do.
Rintaro|We’ll have plenty of time to talk about that later. More importantly, Daru, when do you think we can use the IBN 5100 to hack SERN?
Itaru|Hmm... well...
Itaru|Wow, it actually turned on.
Itaru|First I need to learn how to use this thing. It looks like hooking it up is gonna be a pain.
Itaru|It might take a while. I can’t play with this thing and search for the server admin’s ID at the same time.
Rintaro|Alright. Prioritize the ID search.
Rintaro|If possible, I’d like you to get the IBN 5100 ready to use this month, though.
Itaru|There’s still 30 days left this month. It’s not gonna take that long.
Mayuri|We’re gonna take off now, okay?
Luka|Um, pardon the intrusion.
Rintaro|You two did well today. Be proud.
Kurisu|You’re so full of yourself.
Mayuri|Chris-chan, you not going home? You can walk with us to the station if you want.
Kurisu|Thanks. But I’m going to stay here a little longer.
Mayuri|Okay. See you later! Tutturu♪
Luka|Excuse me.
Kurisu|Well?
Rintaro|Well, what?
Kurisu|I’m asking for an explanation. What’s this about the IBN 5100 and SERN?
Kurisu|Hey, Okabe.
Rintaro|...What?
Rintaro|What did you just call me?
Kurisu|I called you O-Okabe.
Rintaro|You called me Okabe?
Itaru|Time out, time out!
Rintaro|Did you just call me Okabe?
Kurisu|...I did. Problem?
Kurisu|Yes, I’m younger than you, but you insist on calling me by ridiculous names like Christina and Zombie, so I don’t think I need to show you any respect by adding ’-san’, and besides--
Rintaro|That’s not the problem!
Kurisu|!!
Rintaro|I am not Okabe! I am HOUOUIN KYOUMA! How many times do I have to tell you, Christina!?
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|...God, you’re so full of yourself.
Rintaro|From now on, call me Hououin. That or Kyouma.
Kurisu|No.
Rintaro|Are you... crying?
Kurisu|I’m not crying! It’s not like I was scared of you for a second there or anything, and I definitely wasn’t relieved when you started talking like an idiot again, okay!?
Rintaro|Daru, why is my assistant crying?
Itaru|Uh, she said so herself just now.
Rintaro|All I did was correct her on my name.
Itaru|Maybe she only acts strong but is actually weak on the inside. That would be pretty moe.
Kurisu|Hey, aren’t you going to tell me what’s going on?
Kurisu|Kya!
Rintaro|I’ll explain in a second. Drink that while you wait.
Kurisu|...Gee, thanks.
Rintaro|Now then...
Rintaro|Sorry for the wait, Christina.
Rintaro|Oh? You’re a fan of the Doc, I see.
Kurisu|I’ve lived seven years at its birthplace, after all.
Rintaro|Excellent. We’ll make great drinking buddies.
Kurisu|I’m a minor.
Rintaro|That’s not what I meant. I meant Dr P drinking buddies.
Kurisu|Is that all you drink?
Kurisu|SERN certainly is acting strange... but how’s the IBN 5100 involved?
Rintaro|SERN’s database uses an IBN 5100.
Kurisu|So?
Rintaro|Allow me to explain. My trusted Super Hacka, Mister Daru--
Itaru|It’s not super hacka. How many times do I have to tell you?
Rintaro|Super Hacker Mister Daru, has hacked into SERN.
Kurisu|Is that okay? Won’t they catch you?
Itaru|I wouldn’t make a blunder like that.
Kurisu|That’s not what I meant.
Rintaro|As a result, we found evidence that those bastards are researching time travel with the LHC.
Kurisu|The LHC?
Itaru|Seriously. We have the evidence. And guess what? The LHC has been in operation for nine years.
Kurisu|What? Really!?
Rintaro|And they’ve successfully generated mini black holes.
Kurisu|No way... Then why haven’t they made an official announcement!?
Rintaro|That’s just it. For some reason, those bastards won’t announce any of it.
Rintaro|That the LHC has been operating for nine years. That they’ve successfully created mini black holes. That they’re researching time travel.
Rintaro|Basically, it’s proof that SERN has--
Rintaro|Basically, it’s proof that SERN has something to hide. Can’t you just smell the conspiracy?
Kurisu|I don’t believe in conspiracies, but...
Kurisu|If you can prove what you said is real, then I might be surprised. SERN doing time travel research...
Kurisu|Ah, but what about the IBN 5100? How is that involved?
Rintaro|SERN’s database uses--
Rintaro|Sorry. Daru, please continue the explanation.
Rintaro|So, how far did you get?
Itaru|Up to the point where SERN’s using IBN 5100 code for their database.
Rintaro|So basically, what that means is--
Rintaro|The only way to decrypt that database is to use an IBN 5100 of our own.
Kurisu|How do you know that?
Rintaro|I have my sources.
Kurisu|Setting the IBN 5100 and such aside...
Kurisu|I want to see proof that SERN’s really doing that sort of research.
Rintaro|Daru. Will it take much longer to find the server admin’s account?
Itaru|Actually, I was just thinking about doing that. It shouldn’t take more than half a day, I guess.
Rintaro|There you go.
Kurisu|...I’ll wait until then.
Itaru|You’ll wait? It’s already getting dark. Why not go home for tonight and come back tomorrow morning?
Kurisu|No thanks. I’ll wait. I want to know as soon as possible, even if it’s just a microsecond sooner.
Rintaro|Heh heh heh, that’s the spirit. You’re already fascinated by the conspiracy. You can’t help but want to know what lies at the heart of SERN.
Kurisu|If what you guys are saying is true... then this isn’t something to joke about.
Kurisu|SERN is the world’s top research institution. If they’re doing secret experiments without publishing their results...
Kurisu|They’re making fools of scientists the world over.
Kurisu|That’s only if it’s true, though.
Rintaro|Anyway, Daru. I’ll leave it to you.
Kurisu|Can you show me the PhoneWave?
Rintaro|Indeed I can. Want to experiment?
Kurisu|You haven’t been able to send another email to the past yet, right?
Kurisu|Do you know why?
Kurisu|Let’s run some tests.
Kurisu|Man. You have a ton of junk. 
Rintaro|It’s not junk!
Rintaro|Since you’re new to the Future Gadget Laboratory, I’ll explain. These are the glorious fruits of our science: the Future Gadgets!
Rintaro|Future Gadgets 1-7 are stored here. The PhoneWave, with which you are already familiar, is Gadget Number 8.
Kurisu|Future Gadgets, huh...
Kurisu|Hey. Isn’t this... a weapon?
Rintaro|Future Gadget No. 4: Moad Snake, designed after a claymore landmine, is an instant humidifier.
Kurisu|How confusing.
Rintaro|Insert water and turn the power on, and in mere seconds, it generates a thick cloud of steam.
Kurisu|So it’s junk. I thought so.
Kurisu|I’m borrowing this.
Rintaro|Whoa!
Kurisu|It’s just not right without a lab coat.
Kurisu|Hey!
Rintaro|Assistant! You get it, don’t you!?
Kurisu|G-get what? Let go!
Rintaro|If you’re gonna do science, you need a lab coat! Right!?
Rintaro|I knew you were meant for this, Christina! You’re the best assistant a mad scientist could ask for!
Kurisu|I don’t know if that’s supposed to be a compliment, but it’s coming off as an insult. Now let go!
Rintaro|I’m giving you that lab coat to commemorate your joining the lab. Don’t worry. It’s never been worn.
Rintaro|Or maybe this fateful encounter between you and that lab coat was decided by destiny long ago. Daru not wearing it was just another inevitability. This is the choice of Steins--
Kurisu|Shut up so we can start the experiment.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...So you haven’t tampered with the microwave at all?
Rintaro|It’s in terminal mode now. We can change the factory settings like this, make the microwave do things its manufacturer never intended.
Kurisu|How was it set when the discharge phenomenon occurred?
Rintaro|Nothing out of the ordinary. It was at factory settings.
Kurisu|Hmm.
Kurisu|I’ll take a banana.
Rintaro|Those are Mayuri’s.
Kurisu|Oh, so I don’t need your permission, then. I’ll go buy new bananas tomorrow.
Kurisu|...Nothing happened.
Kurisu|Ow!
Kurisu|It’s hot.
Rintaro|Meaning the microwave functioned normally.
Rintaro|What does this mean...
Kurisu|I guess what happened earlier was an irregularity after all.
Rintaro|I don’t know if it’s an irregularity or not, but we ought to investigate the cause.
Kurisu|I agree.
Rintaro|In the previous experiment...
Rintaro|After spending 120 seconds in the PhoneWave (name subject to change), the banana teleported back to the bunch gelified. We should consider that it returned to its state 120 seconds before.
Kurisu|Wrong. If it returned to its state 120 seconds before, it wouldn’t be gelified.
Rintaro|The chicken returned to its frozen state without gelifying.
Kurisu|That logic is dubious. Sure it ended up frozen, but did you examine the possibility that it might have gelified first?
Rintaro|Salt didn’t gelify.
Kurisu|You mean nothing changed.
Rintaro|After the discharge phenomenon occurred last time, we spent all night experimenting with cabbage, radishes, rice, konjac, melon bread, Crunchy-kun, and cup noodles. Nothing happened.
Rintaro|The same thing with liquids. On that day, our success rate took a 180 degree turn.
Rintaro|Before the discharge phenomenon, everything succeeded. After the discharge phenomenon, everything failed.
Kurisu|Is the microwave storing electricity?
Kurisu|You said that gelified objects became fractal structured, right?
Kurisu|Salt has a simple structure by nature, so maybe that had an effect. But how could electricity be related...
Rintaro|Here, we should think under the assumptions of time travel theory.
Kurisu|No. It’s not good to start thinking from the conclusion.
Rintaro|We’ve already had several successful experiments. You can’t deny that.
Kurisu|I’m not especially concerned whether this thing is a time machine or not.
Kurisu|To begin with, it’s physically impossible for this tiny little microwave to produce energy equivalent to the big bang.
Kurisu|We can’t reproduce the discharge phenomenon, nor the fractalization. There should be a reason why.
Kurisu|We haven’t changed our methods. We haven’t changed the settings. We haven’t changed the experimental subjects either. There must be some other variable.
Rintaro|Maybe it’s the one who observes it.
Kurisu|What do you mean by that?
Rintaro|Quantum theory. The observer is an important element to the experiment.
Kurisu|There were four of us here when the discharge phenomenon occurred last time. But before that, it occurred when Hashida-san was alone.
Kurisu|Each time fractalization occurred, there were either two or three people observing.
Kurisu|You and I each saw both phenomena.
Kurisu|In other words, the conditions haven’t changed.
Rintaro|In that case...
Kurisu|Hmmm...
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|Hungry?
Kurisu|Sh-shut up! I haven’t eaten anything since lunch.
Kurisu|It’s already 8?
Rintaro|Just eat a banana. But only one of the two we just warmed. They are, after all, the fruit of our experiments.
Rintaro|Or you could take something from our stock of cup noodles.
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|Don’t want any? Well, since you have lived in America for so long, I guess you’d prefer fast food instead--
Kurisu|Cup noodles.
Rintaro|What?
Kurisu|I’ll have cup noodles.
Rintaro|Cup noodles!?
Kurisu|What flavors?
Rintaro|There’s soy sauce flavor and chicken flavor.
Kurisu|Chicken.
Kurisu|Also... do you have a fork?
Rintaro|Christina, is it okay to stay here this late? Perhaps you should contact your family.
Kurisu|No need.
Rintaro|What? Do your parents let you do whatever you want?
Kurisu|I haven’t seen my father in seven years. My mother is in America. I’m living in a hotel right now. Understand?
Rintaro|Wha...!
Rintaro|You damn celebrity! If you’re American, then you should at least use a motel instead of a hotel, right!?
Kurisu|I’m not American, and there aren’t any motels in the heart of Tokyo.
Rintaro|What sort of hotel?
Kurisu|What do you mean? It’s a normal hotel in Ochanomizu.
Rintaro|Ochanomizu? Then you can walk there from here, can’t you?
Kurisu|Sure.
Rintaro|So, tell me about your father.
Kurisu|Sorry?
Rintaro|You said you haven’t seen him in seven years?
Kurisu|Why do you care about my father?
Rintaro|You’re the one who mentioned him. Isn’t that basically a hidden message saying ’please give me some advice about my father, please’?
Kurisu|You’re crazy.
Rintaro|You are my assistant! And I can’t let my assistant have any worries. So tell me everything that’s on your mind!
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|What’s wrong?
Kurisu|I have nothing to say to you.
Rintaro|Oh, I know!
Rintaro|Your father was a hero, but then he fell to evil and now he wears a black mask and cape and goes ’heeeee koohhh’, right!? And in the future, you two are destined to fight and--
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|...Y-you’re really mad at me, aren’t you?
Kurisu|Don’t make fun...
Kurisu|Of people’s family issues like that. You’re trampling on my heart.
Rintaro|...
Itaru|Hell yeahhhhhhh!
Rintaro|Did you get it!?
Itaru|Mission complete.
Itaru|I got the server admin’s ID and password. Now we can peep as much as we want, hyahoohh!
Rintaro|And the IBN 5100 database?
Itaru|That’s separate, duh. The server admin’s unrelated.
Itaru|I mean, it’s a database with normally unreadable code, so there’s a limit on who can access it. Doesn’t look like even the lab director can access it.
Rintaro|There are positions higher than that?
Itaru|There’s something called the SERN Executive Council.
Rintaro|Hmm... So they call it a council, eh?
Itaru|What about it?
Rintaro|It’s a fitting name for our enemy!
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|Run a search for data on time travel research.
Itaru|Okey-dokey. That Z Program we saw last time was suspicious, wasn’t it?
Rintaro|That, and the Jellyman’s Report.
Rintaro|Look carefully. And burn it into your eyes. The proof of SERN’s actions, its deceit upon the world.
Itaru|Oh yeah, baby. Found the LHC project supervisor.
Rintaro|The supervisor... that’s a pretty important post.
Itaru|Right now, we’re peeking inside his computer.
Itaru|Z Program, Z Program... hmm...
Rintaro|Z obviously stands for jelly (zerii)!
Kurisu|Jelly starts with J. J-E-L-L-Y.
Itaru|Pfft, careless mistake. So uncool.
Rintaro|Ahem! What I meant to say is that there’s no way it would have such a simple name. The name’s hiding something important. There has to be a double meaning!
Itaru|Got it!
Itaru|The program began... in 1973.
Rintaro|When was SERN formed?
Kurisu|1954.
Rintaro|When was the IBN 5100 put on market?
Itaru|1975.
Itaru|Ugh, a JPEG? Come on! I can’t copypaste this.
Kurisu|Hmmm, the text isn’t in French...
Itaru|Actually, there’s French, Dutch, and German versions too. The content looks the same, though.
Kurisu|...’SERN’s purpose heading into the 21st Century shall be to establish control over space and time, thereby to enable the destruction of extant history and the creation of an everlasting Utopia,
Kurisu|ruled by the Committee, that encompasses the entirety of past and future events.’
Itaru|Oh, right! Makise-shi can do English!
Rintaro|Way to go, assistant! Your study abroad in America was all for the sake of today, wasn’t it!?
Kurisu|Of course not. Stop assigning people roles in your fantasy world.
Kurisu|’In order to maintain this project’s secrecy, and to allow its name to remain relevant in changing circumstances, we designate it the Z Program.’
Kurisu|’Z, like the Greek Omega or the Cyrillic Ya.’
Kurisu|’It is forbidden to assign any meaning to this name or to seek in it significance beyond the project itself. Negative returns are predicted should this edict be violated.’
Kurisu|’The Z Program is a top secret project spanning international borders. Like electromagnetic wave research, it has been approved for top priority funding by the Committee of 300.’
Kurisu|’Henceforth, all other research performed by SERN shall function to keep the Z Program’s existence secret.’
Rintaro|Is there anything specific about what exactly the Z Program is?
Kurisu|Hmm... ah... here.
Kurisu|This... can’t be!
Rintaro|What is it?
Kurisu|’The purpose of the Z Program is to perform time-space displacement experiments by means of high-energy proton-proton collisions.’
Rintaro|Time travel!
Kurisu|No way... it was true?
Kurisu|You’re telling me they’ve been deceiving the world for nearly 40 years?
Rintaro|Just as I suspected. A great shadow lurks behind SERN. Most likely the Organization, or one of its puppets.’
Kurisu|What Organization, you chuunibyou nutjob? At least try to be serious some of the time.
Rintaro|Hmph, don’t be ridiculous. My words are always grounded in truth.
Itaru|Anyway, shouldn’t it be ’the Committee’ instead of ’the Organization’? That’s what it says here.
Kurisu|The Committee of 300? I don’t think they mean SERN’s Executive Council. What are they talking about?
Rintaro|The world is full of lies. It’s not as beautiful as you think.
Itaru|Listen, Okarin...
Rintaro|I am listening. The Committee of 300 is the dark power that controls every secret society, every government, every multinational corporation.
Kurisu|You’re making things up again.
Rintaro|It’s the truth. Google it if you don’t believe me.
Rintaro|Until now, the human race, for all its accomplishments, has never been able to overcome the barrier called time.
Rintaro|The technology of time travel, which can break through that barrier, will change the course of human history. Literally.
Rintaro|As it was when we split the atom, this forbidden fruit has the potential to grant us godlike power. Not a man exists who can resist its temptation.
Rintaro|And naturally, all those with power will use any means at their disposal to obtain it. Human morality is naught but a joke to those who would stand with the gods.
Rintaro|Understand, Christina?
Kurisu|...Wow. That was quite a speech.
Kurisu|Since you seem to know so much about it, does that mean you’re aiming for godhood too?
Rintaro|What Hououin Kyouma desires is the destruction of all who would call themselves gods, the collapse of their hateful System, and a glorious new age of Chaos. Muhahaha!
Kurisu|I’m not asking Hououin. I’m asking Okabe.
Rintaro|I... I am Hououin!
Kurisu|In other words, you don’t have your own reason.
Itaru|Forget about him, Makise-shi. Please keep reading.
Rintaro|Daru! What do you mean forget about me?
Itaru|I’m tired of listening to conspiracy theories. I’m more interested in the Z Program than in your delusions.
Rintaro|Continue, assistant.
Kurisu|At least show respect when you’re asking a favor...
Kurisu|Umm...
Kurisu|’Stage 1: Construction and implementation of the Large Hadron Collider.’
Kurisu|’Over the past half century, beginning with the Proton Synchrotron completed in 1959, particle accelerator technology has reached the point where standardized results may be obtained.’
Kurisu|’Stage 2: Implementation and testing of lifter technology.’
Kurisu|’The formation of more than two artificial localized singularities, as well as the formation of Kerr black holes, will become possible when this stage is complete.’
Kurisu|’In order to hide the program’s true goal, it is necessary to intentionally leak misinformation regarding the formation of black holes.’
Kurisu|’Stage 3: Animal experimentation.’
Kurisu|’Stage 4...
Kurisu|...Human experimentation.
Itaru|...For real?
Itaru|H-hey, Okarin. Remember when we hacked in before? I’m pretty sure that email we read said this...
Itaru|Result: Error. Human is dead, mismatch. For details, see the Jellyman’s Report...
Rintaro|...
Itaru|Could that have something to do with... human experimentation?
Rintaro|Daru... look up the Jellyman’s Report.
Itaru|Really?
Rintaro|Really. But first, Christina.
Kurisu|Eh?
Rintaro|You should leave.
Kurisu|Why are you suddenly--
Rintaro|The Jellyman’s Report... it just gives me a bad feeling. Once we see it, we can no longer return to our normal lives.
Rintaro|You’re a genius. You’re already published, for crying out loud. There’s no need to throw away your promising future.
Kurisu|Are you worried about me?
Rintaro|Of course I am. You are my assistant, after all.
Kurisu|...I keep telling you, I’m not your assistant.
Kurisu|Thanks for your concern. But I’m not leaving. We need to expose this truth to the world.
Rintaro|No! It’s too dangerous.
Kurisu|You chickening out?
Rintaro|We’re powerless against this conspiracy. One wrong move, and they’ll have us erased.
Kurisu|But still--
Rintaro|This isn’t a game! I’m not joking here.
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|...Fine. I won’t tell anyone.
Kurisu|But I’m not leaving. It’ll keep me awake at night.
Rintaro|You won’t regret this?
Kurisu|I won’t.
Rintaro|What about you, Daru? Prepared?
Itaru|Well, I am a super hacker.
Itaru|And with my skills, they’ll never know we were there.
Rintaro|Alright... let’s begin.
Rintaro|Henceforth, this shall be known as Operation Laegjarn’s Chest!
Kurisu|Why Norse mythology?
Itaru|Is that Norse mythology? Because it’s cool, I guess.
Kurisu|Anyway, what is it with men and military terms...
Rintaro|Daru, begin the operation!
Itaru|Ready? I’m opening it.
Kurisu|’Jellyman’s Report 10’
Kurisu|’Subject: James McCarthy, Age: 31, American’
Kurisu|’Z Program Stage 4, Date of Experiment: 2005-01-28 T13:05’
Kurisu|’Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.’
Itaru|That again...
Kurisu|’It is believed that due to infinite compression by supergravity, the subject could not endure passage through the singularity inside the Kerr black hole.’
Kurisu|’April 3, 1921. New York City. An unidentified man was discovered dead in an alley off Union Square. The right half of his body was embedded in a nearby wall.’
Kurisu|’The man’s body...
Kurisu|...was completely gelified.’
Itaru|What’s going on here?
Itaru|They... gelified someone?
Kurisu|They’re experimenting on people...
Kurisu|And this means they’ve created a time machine, doesn’t it? Even if it’s not perfect.
Rintaro|Eh...?
Kurisu|This New York Times article is from 1921.
Rintaro|90 years ago...
Kurisu|Look.
Rintaro|SERN...
Itaru|So... SERN used the LHC to send someone back to 1921?
Kurisu|Looks like they failed to keep him alive, though.
Rintaro|Is this the only report?
Itaru|No, there’s more. Looks like... 14 people in total.
Rintaro|More Jellymen? That means more gelified people... more victims of human experimentation...
Rintaro|Show me the others.
Kurisu|’Jellyman’s Report 9.’

Kurisu|’Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.’
Kurisu|The newspaper clipping... I think it’s in French. I can’t read it.
Rintaro|You can read the date, though. January 31, 2001.
Kurisu|The location is... Pau, France, I guess.

Kurisu|’Result: Error. Human is Dead. Mismatch.’
Kurisu|’On July 1, 1985, a strange body washed ashore on the coast of Streymoy, Faroe Islands.’ 
Kurisu|’It appeared to be the body of an adult male, but its flesh was soft like that of a jellyfish. Some of the island’s inhabitants believe that it was the body of a merman.’
Kurisu|’The inscription ’SERN’ was found near the body’s shoulder, but SERN denies any involvement.’
Itaru|Keep looking?
Rintaro|I’ve seen enough.
Kurisu|The sites are spread throughout the world. What can we deduce from this?
Rintaro|They must have sent them to those places.
Kurisu|I don’t think so. It’s too random.
Itaru|There was something about Kerr black holes and gravity, right? Isn’t that the cause?
Kurisu|It is believed that due to infinite compression by supergravity, the subject could not endure passage through the Kerr black hole’s singularity.’
Kurisu|That’s what it said.
Itaru|What’s a Kerr black hole? Is it different from a regular black hole?
Kurisu|It’s a theoretical black hole with a rotating singularity. Their existence hasn’t been proven yet. Not that there’s any way to prove one exists.
Rintaro|That’s right... John Titor!
Rintaro|According to Titor, SERN finished their time machine in 2034. And then Titor himself came from 2036.
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|Creating Kerr black holes? That’s insane. If you screw up, it could swallow the Earth... and besides, Kerr black holes are just a theoretical construct.
Rintaro|If Titor’s predictions are a reality, then that means the LHC worst case scenario video on MewTube was right.
Itaru|I don’t know about Titor’s predictions, but I’ve seen the problem video before. It was on the news two or three years ago.
Kurisu|The gravitational forces inside a black hole are unbelievably powerful. It’s certainly possible that passing through one could allow time displacement, but there’s no way a human could do that and come out alive.
Rintaro|That must be how these people got gelified.
Kurisu|It wouldn’t just gelify you. It would tear you apart particle from particle. That’s what a black hole does.
Itaru|Before we discuss this, shouldn’t we look through the rest of their time machine research?
Itaru|Here we go! There’s a file in the Z Program that explains time travel theory.
Kurisu|That was pretty easy to find. SERN should have better security.
Itaru|Their security’s fine. I’m just too good.
Rintaro|Daru is my Favorite Right Arm.
Kurisu|I thought he was your super hacka.
Itaru|Hacker!
Rintaro|So what does it say, Christina?
Kurisu|Umm... can you give me some time to read it?
Kurisu|No way... but this is...
Kurisu|Is Titor really...?
Rintaro|What are you muttering about? Tell me what it says.
Kurisu|...Oh, right.
Kurisu|You know, this feels like one big joke.
Rintaro|What do you mean?
Kurisu|It’s almost the same. The same as Titor’s theory.
Kurisu|Basically...
Kurisu|The LHC smashes protons together at 99.9999991% the speed of light.
Kurisu|By doing so, they compress a mass of 10₃kg into an extremely tiny space of 10µm.
Itaru|In Japanese please. Three lines max.
Kurisu|A small mass.
Kurisu|Thrust into a narrow space.
Kurisu|With great force.
Itaru|That explanation’s too erotic!
Kurisu|Huh? What part of it is erot--
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|...Ah!
Kurisu|H-Hashida, you pervert!!
Itaru|Sounds like you have a pretty good imagination yourself.
Kurisu|I-I’m not like you!
Rintaro|Don’t listen to this fool, Christina. Continue.
Kurisu|...ugh.
Kurisu|Uh, what were we talking about?
Itaru|Thrusting with great force.
Rintaro|Proton compression.
Kurisu|Right. Successful compression generates a micro-singularity, which--
Itaru|A micro singularity? Not a mini black hole?
Rintaro|Same thing, essentially. A singularity is the core of a black hole.
Kurisu|This process generates a black hole with two micro-singularities.
Itaru|Explain with cute girls.
Kurisu|Fine. Say there are two cute girls, Mic-chan and Cro-chan.
Itaru|Sisters are moe. Haah, haah.
Kurisu|By feeding Mic-chan and Cro-chan electrons, you can make them do whatever you want.
Itaru|Electric shock torture? This some sort of eroge?
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|So you force them to rotate at an extremely high velocity.
Kurisu|And then, theoretically, Mic-chan and Cro-chan transform into Magical Girl ’Ring Singularity’.
Itaru|Cue stock transformation scene. Got it.
Kurisu|The resulting black hole exhibits what’s called the Kerr effect.
Itaru|What are Kerr black holes anyway? You said they spin, but what does that mean?
Kurisu|Exactly what it sounds like.
Itaru|But don’t black holes usually spin? I mean, there’s a whirlpool around the hole, right? 
Kurisu|The part that looks like it’s spinning is just the surrounding matter being sucked into the black hole.
Kurisu|A black hole is just a point where extreme mass causes gravitational collapse. Everything falls towards it.
Kurisu|Since it’s only a point, it doesn’t spin.
Kurisu| A Kerr black hole has a ring at its center, not a point.
Kurisu|Think of it like this. Once transformed into magical girls, Mic-chan and Cro-chan’s hearts spin like a ring inside their bodies, which is impossible for normal people.
Itaru|...I’ll pass on the guro.
Rintaro|Before, you said that such a black hole’s existence would be impossible to prove. What did you mean?
Kurisu|A black hole has what’s called an event horizon.
Kurisu|Once you pass the event horizon, time and space switch places.
Rintaro|Time and space switch places?
Kurisu|Right now, we can move freely through space and into the future, but we can’t move even one minute into the past. That becomes reversed.
Kurisu|On the other side of the event horizon, moving freely through space becomes impossible, while moving freely through time becomes possible.
Kurisu|Since unrestricted spatial movement is impossible, you can never escape a black hole.
Kurisu|For example, if Okabe jumped into a black hole, time for him would stretch to infinity.
Kurisu|Since light cannot escape, human eyes cannot see the other side of the event horizon.
Kurisu|Observing a black hole from the outside is impossible, so nothing about the inside can be proven.
Kurisu|There is an exception, however. This exception is vital when you use a Kerr black hole for time travel.
Rintaro|Get to the point.
Kurisu|The Kerr black hole’s ring singularity. Since it’s spinning, it has angular momentum.
Itaru|Like I said, in Japanese please.
Kurisu|Didn’t I already explain how the core spins? Just think of that as having momentum.
Kurisu|If you keep giving Mic-chan and Cro-chan electrons, they’ll rotate faster and faster.
Kurisu|And when their angular momentum exceeds a certain threshold, the event horizon will disappear, and the singularity will become a naked singularity.
Itaru|N-naked? You mean the magical girl costumes expose a lot of skin, right? When does the anime adaptation air?
Rintaro|Naked, you mean it becomes observable.
Kurisu|When the event horizon disappears, there’s no more reason for time and space to change places. Meaning that you can enter a naked singularity without being trapped.
Kurisu|And then the existence of the naked singularity allows the principle of causality to be violated and the general theory of relativity to fail.
Kurisu|The laws of physics are broken!
Rintaro|C-can such a thing exist?
Kurisu|Nothing in principle stops Kerr black holes from existing. It seems inconsistent, but the math never lies.
Kurisu|Since the principle of causality fails, it would be possible to travel to the past by entering a naked singularity.
Kurisu|One thing I don’t understand is how they inject electrons into the singularity.
Kurisu|Look. This is a picture of the LHC, but there’s strange equipment installed at the proton collision site.
Kurisu|It looks like they call it a ’lifter’, but... just what is it?
Rintaro|Daru, have you heard of it?
Itaru|Lifter, lifter... I think I saw that in the Z Program files. Wanna google it?
Itaru|We’ve got hits!
Kurisu|That many? I guess it’s not a secret...
Rintaro|Could this be it? Ionocraft.
Kurisu|Ions are charged particles. The meaning matches.
Itaru|It’s floating...
Rintaro|That’s... an anti-gravity device!
Kurisu|Don’t be ridiculous. That would be the breakthrough of the century.
Kurisu|It’s called an ionocraft, so it probably has something to do with electrodes and charged air...
Rintaro|SERN is using this lifter technology. It’s a vital component of their time machine.
Rintaro|If they can manipulate a micro singularity’s mass and gravitational field, then these things really are anti-gravity devices!
Kurisu|Well, under those exact conditions, I guess you might not be entirely wrong.
Kurisu|But it looks like SERN’s having trouble adjusting their lifter.
Kurisu|They don’t have full control over the micro singularity’s gravity. So they can’t make a true naked singularity.
Rintaro|That must be the reason why the subjects turned into jellymen.
Kurisu|Since the singularity is still closed, the subject is crushed by its tremendous gravity.
Kurisu|As a result, substances become fractalized. Let’s go with that hypothesis. Of course, there’s no way to be sure that it’s right. It might take months to prove.
Rintaro|So SERN’s lifter is still incomplete...
Rintaro|If we can complete the PhoneWave (name subject to change) first, then we’ll have outwitted SERN!
Kurisu|We don’t have half the equipment or funding SERN does. What makes you think you can solve a problem that they can’t?
Kurisu|This isn’t that simple.
Kurisu|SERN still hasn’t figured out how to set the subject’s destination in time or space.
Kurisu|That should be evident by how scattered the jellyman discoveries were.
Kurisu|We don’t even know if this is all of them. There could be jellymen buried underground or floating in space. Actually, I’m almost certain there are.
Kurisu|There’s no point traveling through time if you end up in tens of thousands of kilometers away from the Earth. It’s not practical at all.
Rintaro|Titor said he had a ’variable gravity lock system’. He can use that to lock onto the Earth’s gravity and ensure he arrives somewhere on the planet’s surface.
Kurisu|Titor’s explanation on that point was vague.
Kurisu|He mentioned having such a device, but he didn’t explain how it worked.
Itaru|But if you’re only moving through time, won’t you just arrive in the same location?
Kurisu|Of course not.
Itaru|Why not?
Rintaro|Because the Earth is always moving.
Kurisu|Right. Rotation and revolution.
Kurisu|The Earth’s rotational velocity is about 1,650 kilometers per hour.
Kurisu|Its orbital velocity around the sun is about 114,000 kilometers per hour.
Kurisu|Meaning one hour ago, we were that far away from where we are now.
Itaru|Whoa! When you think about it like that, we’re earth-shatteringly fast!
Kurisu|And that’s not all.
Kurisu|The Solar System is part of the Milky Way. And the Milky Way spins like a giant whirlpool.
Kurisu|There are various theories, but basically the earth moves about 50 million kilometers a day.
Itaru|We’ve kinda gotten to a ludicrous scale.
Kurisu|By the way, the Milky Way is part of a large cluster of galaxies, which is itself part of an even larger supercluster.
Kurisu|And these clusters and superclusters might be moving too. If that’s the case, we’re moving even more than 50 million kilometers a day.
Kurisu|The point is that setting the destination would require insane calculations, even if you only want to travel one second into the past.
Kurisu|Doing it by hand is impossible, and it might take years for a supercomputer to come up with a solution, just to get you to the same location.
Rintaro|Then we have no choice. We need to find Titor and borrow his variable gravity system.
Kurisu|Great idea. Go for it.
Kurisu|I wonder how SERN is dealing with this problem...
Rintaro|...
Itaru|...
Kurisu|Okabe.
Kurisu|Thanks.
Female Reporter|Five days have passed since the satellite crash, and with the start of summer vacation season, crowds are gathering to get a glimpse of the satellite, which still has not been removed.
Teenage Girl|I came from Nagoya. I wanted to see it.
Middle-aged Man|I drove all the way from Saitama. It’s amazing! Where did that thing come from?
Teenage Girl 2|Yay! I’m a high school girl from Chiba♪
Female Reporter|Tourists from all over Japan are flocking to this location.
Female Reporter|In an interview earlier today, Michael Byrne, spokesman for NASA, stated...
Female Reporter|That no satellite had crashed in Japan, and that the crashed object was, in fact, not even a satellite.
Female Reporter|The satellite is currently under police investigation. No date for removal has been set.
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Good morning! Oh wait, should I say, good afternoon?
Mayuri|Whoo! The air in here is sooo thick.
Mayuri|I’ll refresh the air!
Rintaro|Since all lab mems are present and accounted for, this is the perfect opportunity to hold another Round Table Conference.
Mayuri|Roundabout confluence?
Itaru|...What’s that?
Rintaro|A meeting of lab mems.
Itaru|Have we ever done that before?
Kurisu|Do you even have a round table?
Rintaro|Not physically. However, it exists in the hearts of all lab mems. Am I mistaken?
Kurisu|Yes, you’re mistaken. Don’t go sticking things in people’s hearts.
Mayuri|Is there one in Mayushii too?
Rintaro|Of course there is.
Mayuri|Oh, that’s good. But what’s a roundable?
Itaru|And why a round table? You King Arthur?
Kurisu|I’m only a temporary lab mem anyway.
Rintaro|Anyway, it’s a Round Table Conference! Mayuri wasn’t here last night, so first, let’s explain the situation to her.
Mayuri|I told you you shouldn’t do bad things.
Rintaro|Hmph, ’bad’ you say? We are bad? Absurd.
Rintaro|If we’re bad, then SERN is even worse. They aren’t satisfied with ruling the world. Now they want to get their hands on space-time itself!
Kurisu|I agree.
Kurisu|What SERN is doing is unforgivable. They’re traitors to humanity, to society, and to science.
Mayuri|I guess...
Rintaro|Anyway, Ragnarok can no longer be averted. The final battle with SERN is near.
Mayuri|Rag in a rock?
Kurisu|Norse mythology again?
Rintaro|Christina! I ordered you to investigate SERN! What have you learned?
Kurisu|I don’t remember being ordered, but whatever.
Kurisu|There are two problems SERN faces with time travel.
Kurisu|First is the electron injection device, also known as a ’lifter’.
Kurisu|Unless they get it to function properly, they can’t make the Kerr black hole singularites naked.
Kurisu|If you send a test subject through the singularity in its current state, the supergravity compresses them to the micro level. Naturally, there’s no way to survive.
Kurisu|The second problem is that they can’t specify a physical destination. They can’t choose where they end up after traveling to the past.
Kurisu|That’s why I’d say the 14 found jellymen were the lucky ones.
Kurisu|Over a hundred human experiments have been performed since 2001. The remaining 80 or so people ended up somewhere they can’t be found.
Mayuri|Why can’t they be found?
Itaru|Didn’t you know, Mayu-shi? The world is constantly moving. Its rotational speed is 1500 kph, and its orbital speed is 114,000 kph--
Kurisu|SERN has been looking for solutions, but it’s not going well.
Rintaro|Now then. Have you learned anything that could help us complete the PhoneWave (name subject to change)?
Kurisu|Hmm...
Kurisu|Well, I suppose you could call the LHC the world’s largest microwave oven.
Rintaro|Of course! In other words, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is a miniature LHC!
Kurisu|You might be on to something there.
Kurisu|However, there are too many things we don’t know about the PhoneWave. Why do the same phenomena that occur in SERN’s time machine also occur in that tiny little microwave?
Kurisu|Unlike the LHC, this thing wasn’t made for time travel.
Mayuri|It was made to warm Mayushii’s chicken!
Kurisu|W-well, yeah.
Rintaro|Since the jellyman phenomenon occurs with the PhoneWave (name subject to change), Mayuri’s bananas must be reaching the Kerr black hole’s ring singularity.
Mayuri|It makes a black hole? Here?
Mayuri|It won’t suck us in, will it?
Kurisu|But we still haven’t figured out the electric discharge phenomenon, or the conditions required to cause it.
Itaru|During our experiments earlier, we were only able to send emails to the past during the discharge.
Rintaro|Although it hasn’t happened again, that discharge phenomenon could very well signify the injection of charge -- that is, electrons.
Rintaro|And only when it occurs does the path to the singularity open.
Kurisu|We don’t know the cause of the discharge phenomenon.
Rintaro|That’s what we need to find out.
Kurisu|In the first place, the emails we’re sending to the past are digital data, not physical objects. That’s a definite difference from SERN’s time machine.
Rintaro|No, we’re doing the same thing. Who’s to say that digital data can’t go through a singularity? I think it would be easier than sending something human-sized.
Kurisu|Well... I suppose that’s true.
Mayuri|You know, the way you guys talk about email...
Mayuri|It makes me think of folding a letter into a paper airplane and making it go zoom, you know?
Rintaro|It’s more like a beam of light. Like optical digital data.
Rintaro|By the way, it’s a pain to keep saying ’email sent to the past’. Let’s give it a proper name.
Kurisu|I’ve got a bad feeling about this.
Rintaro|What’s that supposed to mean? You dare mock Hououin Kyouma!?
Kurisu|You just want to give it some oddball name, don’t you?
Rintaro|Hmph! How rude. Heed me! I shall name the phenomenon of ’email sent to the past’ as follows. The name shall be...
Rintaro|Nostalgia Drive!
Kurisu|Confusing. Rejected.
Rintaro|Why you! Who gave you the authority to reject my ideas!? You’re just an assistant!
Kurisu|Then why don’t we take a vote? All in favor of Nostalgia Drive.
Rintaro|Have you forsaken me, Daru!? Mayuri!?
Mayuri|Chris-chan’s right. It’s too hard for Mayushii to remember.
Itaru|It’s way too chuuni, man.
Rintaro|Fine! Then let’s hear alternatives! Don’t tell me you rejected my idea without having any bright ideas of your own!?
Kurisu|I think it needs to be something easy to understand. It’s an email that regresses through time, so how about Retromail?
Mayuri|What does ’retro’ mean?
Rintaro|Sounds like you have your answer, Christina. You said it should be easy to understand, but it wasn’t easy to understand at all, was it!?
Kurisu|B-but that’s because Mayuri-san is...
Kurisu|Uh, n-never mind...
Rintaro|Were you about to say ’because Mayuri’s dumb’?
Kurisu|N-no!
Mayuri|Eh? Chris-chan, do you think Mayushii’s dumb?
Kurisu|I don’t! I promise I don’t! Okay?
Itaru|I vote ’The Mail Who Leapt through Time’.
Rintaro|That’s too stiff. It’s hard to say.
Itaru|It’s better than your ’Nostalagisticexpialidocious’ nonsense! And mine makes a movie title referen--
Rintaro|That’s not cool. It needs to be cool.
Itaru|You’re rejecting it for that?
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Mayushii has an idea!
Mayuri|How about ’Back to the Mail’? I took a movie title, and changed a word to mail!
Itaru|I already did the movie joke, Mayu-shi.
Kurisu|Besides, I think the meaning is a little off.
Mayuri|It’s not about the meaning... I took a movie title and changed a word to mail...
Rintaro|Either way, it’s too long!
Itaru|Then how about DeLorean Mail?
Rintaro|That doesn’t even say what kind of email it is!
Kurisu|Hey. We don’t have time for this nonsense. Let’s just abbreviate it to ’D-Mail’ and move on.
Rintaro|But that’s boring.
Kurisu|It don’t care if it’s boring.
Mayuri|D-Mail it is!
Itaru|So why does the D-Mail phenomenon occur?
Rintaro|Because the path through the ring singularity is open. We’ve been over this already.
Kurisu|We don’t know if there’s actually a black hole at work here. It could be an entirely different phenomenon that just happens to resemble SERN’s experiments.
Kurisu|It’s dangerous to jump to conclusions.
Rintaro|Why so timid? Don’t you want our time travel experiments to succeed? That’s why we put our lives on the line to hack SERN!
Rintaro|What we need to figure out is how to turn the PhoneWave (name subject to change) into a usable time machine.
Itaru|Do you really think that’s possible?
Rintaro|There is no think. Only do!
Kurisu|What, did you read that off a motivational poster? You’re like the classic incompetent boss.
Rintaro|Damn you! You dare insult the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!?
Itaru|Well, it’s not like Okarin’s the boss anyway.
Rintaro|Indeed. I am the symbol of this lab, not the boss.
Kurisu|I don’t know what you mean by symbol, but how do you plan to turn the PhoneWave into a time machine? Let’s have details.
Rintaro|My plan... alright, there is one thing.
Rintaro|We’ve been thinking that the electrical discharge happens at random, but I have a hypothesis.
Kurisu|Which is?
Rintaro|Recall the conditions when it occurred, Christina. We experimented through the night with no results, but there’s one variable we overlooked. The simplest, most definitive variable of all.
Rintaro|That is, the time of the occurrence.
Kurisu|...ah.
Rintaro|I checked the times of the two previous occurrences.
Rintaro|When I accidentally sent the first D-Mail to Daru’s phone, it happened between noon and one PM.
Rintaro|The second time, when all four of us observed the D-Mail, it was six PM.
Rintaro|So if we perform the experiment within that timeframe, we might be able to reproduce the effect.
Kurisu|Let’s try it right now!
Itaru|Well, I’m glad to see she has her priorities straight.
Mayuri|Mayushii’s banana supply is getting low... gotta buy more.
Kurisu|Sorry, Mayuri-san. I’ll go buy you some new bananas later.
Mayuri|Really? Yay♪
Mayuri|Okarin and Daru-kun eat my bananas, but they never buy new ones...
Kurisu|First, let’s see if it’ll become a jellyman.
Kurisu|Agh!
Rintaro|Trying for the clumsy girl appeal?
Kurisu|It was an accident!
Kurisu|Put the microwave somewhere else! It’s dangerous and hard to reach like this.
Rintaro|It’ll punch through the floor if we put it on the table.
Mayuri|Chris-chan, Chris-chan! Pain, pain, go away♪
Kurisu|Thanks, Mayuri-san.
Kurisu|Ah!
Itaru|Whoa!
Mayuri|It became a gelbana...
Rintaro|Heh heh heh... muhahaha... MUHAHAHAHA! Just as I suspected, the critical variable was time!
Kurisu|W-way to go, Okabe. It was so simple, I didn’t notice it.
Rintaro|Your praise does you credit, Christina, but I know you’re frustrated you didn’t think of it first. Muhahahaha!
Kurisu|Anyway, let’s see if we can send another D-Mail.
Rintaro|Guh... I feel like my authority has been on the decline since that girl showed up.
Itaru|It’s cool, man. You never had any to begin with.
Kurisu|Help me, you two! Okabe, I’m sending an email to your phone.
Mayuri|What are you gonna send, Chris-chan?
Kurisu|It doesn’t matter what it says. What matters is whether we can send it or not.
Mayuri|Hmm? Lemme see... Okabe is an airhe...?
Rintaro|Wait! You there, assistant! What are you typing?
Kurisu|You’ll see. Ready? I’m sending it.
Itaru|Starting the countdown!
Itaru|3, 2, 1... zero.
Kurisu|Kya!
Rintaro|MUHAHAHAHA! It’s working! It’s working, you guys!
Kurisu|...Did it arrive?
Kurisu|Pfft...
Rintaro|Christina. Did you send two mails?
Kurisu|Eh? No. I only sent one.
Mayuri|Mayushii saw it too. She really only sent one.
Rintaro|But I received two.
Kurisu|You’re right... I even sent it in one sentence, but it got divided.
Rintaro|By the way, what does this word mean?
Kurisu|Why don’t you look it up?
Itaru|That reminds me. The D-Mail from before was cut up mid-sentence too.
Rintaro|Was it?
Itaru|Yeah. Look at your history. I’m pretty sure I sent ’Okarin’s a perv’.
Rintaro|You’re right. This one got split too.
Kurisu|I wonder what’s causing it.
Rintaro|Maybe it’s related to the jellymen.
Mayuri|Um, Mayushii wants to know why it arrived five days ago.
Kurisu|Good point. Didn’t the last one also arrive five days before we sent it?
Rintaro|Yeah. It did.
Itaru|Is there some kind of rule for when it arrives?
Mayuri|Let’s try sending more!
Rintaro|Alright, lab mems! Battle stations!
Kurisu|He’s at it again...
Rintaro|Our mission: to send as many D-Mails as possible!
Rintaro|Daru, man the X68000. Your job is to observe, adjust, and gather information on the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Rintaro|Assistant, keep those mails coming! Try various patterns of text. Japanese, English, full-width, half-width, emoticons. The actual messages don’t matter.
Mayuri|What about Mayushii?
Rintaro|Your mission is to go shopping. Just buy some bananas for now. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall fund you!
Mayuri|Wow! You’re so generous♪
Kurisu|So I guess your job is opening the microwave.
Itaru|Whoa! You saved the easiest job for yourself?
Rintaro|Heh. No, my assistant’s judgment is sound. The key to a successful D-Mail is most likely the correct timing of opening the microwave door!
Kurisu|Uh, I was just kidding.
Rintaro|MUHAHAHAHA! Leave this task to Hououin Kyouma! I shall open this door with precision, boldness, and delicacy, as if it were the flesh of a beautiful woman!
Mayuri|Okarin, that’s naughty!
Rintaro|Furthermore, the current operation is top secret. You must not leak it to anyone. Got it?
Rintaro|Now I shall give this operation a name! It shall be known as Op--
Kurisu|Don’t need one. Let’s start.
Rintaro|Wha... but...
Kurisu|Go ahead and rest. I’m gonna have a go at it a little longer.
Suzuha|Sup!
Suzuha|What shenanigans are you up to this early in the morning?
Rintaro|The kind you wouldn’t believe. We’re building the first time machine in human history.
Suzuha|Huh. Cool.
Rintaro|Hey, shouldn’t you be more surprised!?
Itaru|Can’t blame her for being skeptical. I didn’t think it was possible either.
Itaru|And isn’t that top secret? I thought you didn’t want anyone to know.
Rintaro|Crap! Part-Time Warrior, please keep what I just said a secret.
Suzuha|Sure. By the way...
Suzuha|The boss is really pissed.
Rintaro|Why?
Suzuha|The noise. Whatever you’re doing up there, it’s got the whole building shaking. Dust everywhere. Kinda like an air raid.
Suzuha|He was saying stuff like ’What’s that nutcase doing? I’mma raise his damn rent!’
Suzuha|Maybe you should go apologize.
Itaru|Oh boy. What if he kicks us out?
Rintaro|Alright, leave it to me. Daru, go tell my assistant to lay off the experiments for now.
Itaru|Roger that... I won’t forget you, soldier.
Suzuha|...By the way, is Makise Kurisu here too?
Rintaro|Yeah.
Rintaro|Have you met before?
Suzuha|Um... no. Yesterday was first contact.
Rintaro|First contact?
Rintaro|Oh. Really?
Rintaro|Weren’t you a little hostile for a first contact?
Suzuha|She’s... my enemy.
Rintaro|How can she be your enemy? You just met, right?
Suzuha|Yeah.
Rintaro|Did she do something to you?
Suzuha|Not to me.
Rintaro|What does that mean? She did something to someone else?
Suzuha|...
Rintaro|If you want, I can go talk things over with Christina.
Suzuha|It doesn’t really matter.
Rintaro|Maybe you’re blaming the wrong person?
Suzuha|Geez! Give it a rest!
Suzuha|Anyway! Shouldn’t you apologize to the boss instead of talking to me?
Rintaro|I have come!
Tennouji|Hey, Okabe. The hell are you doing up there?
Rintaro|We’re currently conducting experiments that will change the course of human history. The discoveries we make today will shape the world for centur--
Tennouji|I don’t care what games you guys play. I’m the owner of this building. Got it?
Tennouji|And the building’s really worn out. You keep shaking it like that, you could bring the whole damn thing down on our heads.
Rintaro|Heh heh heh... Veeery interesting, Mister Braun. Don’t tell me you forged this building’s earthquake safety certificate?
Tennouji|What if I did?
Tennouji|It’s been properly reinforced. But regardless, you guys are still shaking it too much.
Rintaro|Hmph! So what if a few buildings collapse?
Tennouji|What’s that?
Rintaro|As I’ve said countless times before, our current experiment is of vital importance to the history of science -- no, to the history of human civilization itself!
Rintaro|It’s more important than prolonging this building’s lifetime for another ten or so measly years!
Tennouji|Okabe!
Tennouji|The ceiling is falling, you dumbass! Some got into my ramen! What are you gonna do about it, huh!? No more shaking!
Tennouji|Or I’ll raise your rent by 10,000!
Rintaro|Leave it to me, Mister Braun! On my honor, I swear there won’t be any more shaking today!
Rintaro|Christina! Stop the experiments at once!
Mayuri|Sorry, Okarin. Mayushii tried to warm up some chicken.
Mayuri|I accidentally put it through reverse rotation, and then it started sparking.
Rintaro|...I see.
Kurisu|I sent you an email. Didn’t you get it?
Rintaro|Stop screwing around! I’m the one who has to deal with Mister Braun!
Kurisu|But I gave you five days advance notice.
Itaru|Was he mad?
Rintaro|Yeah... I could feel his Killing Aura.
Rintaro|Anyway, no more experiments today.
Kurisu|Well, at least we got some good data.
Kurisu|I’m dead tired, and my hair’s dried out. I want to take a shower and go sleep.
Mayuri|If you want a shower, there’s one here. It doesn’t have a bath, though. Okarin always uses it.
Kurisu|It’s probably filthy...
Rintaro|I’d be lying if I called it clean. This entire building is in shambles.
Kurisu|Anyway, I refuse to use the same shower as Okabe.
Rintaro|I understand. Nobody will blame you if you don’t use it. Of course, since the three of us stayed up all night, we’re all pretty smelly. Heh heh heh.
Kurisu|That’s why I’m going back to my hotel once I finish eating.
Rintaro|Celebrity bath time at a high class hotel? I want to come too.
Kurisu|Not a chance.
Mayuri|Mayushii wants to come too!
Kurisu|You can come any time, Mayuri-san.
Mayuri|Really? Thank you♪
Mayuri|Hey, Okarin, I’ve been wondering, but why do you drink soda while you eat? Does it make it taste better?
Rintaro|I don’t really see a problem.
Itaru|Me neither.
Kurisu|Same. I didn’t give it a second thought.
Mayuri|Ehh?
Rintaro|You’re acting weird, Mayuri. It’s normal to drink soda while eating.
Itaru|It’s normal, duh.
Kurisu|No objections.
Mayuri|No way! You guys are the weird ones!
Rintaro|Now, let’s discuss Operation Urd’s progress.
Itaru|Operation Urd?
Rintaro|Oh, right. Thanks to a certain assistant, I didn’t get a chance to present the operation’s codename yesterday. Heed me! These D-Mail experiments are all part of Operation Ur--
Kurisu|The experiments have been fruitful.
Kurisu|At the very least, we’ve learned what we can do with D-Mail.
Kurisu|That about sums it up. Anything to add?
Rintaro|A D-Mail can be at most 36 English characters or 18 Japanese characters long. That makes experimentation difficult, so we’ll want to improve that first.
Itaru|But we figured out how to control when it arrives. That’s pretty good, right?
Kurisu|Observation isn’t enough. We need to find the underlying principle. What I’ve written here is nothing but verified phenomena.
Rintaro|The underlying principle... you’re right. It’s not a complete time machine until we understand how it works.
Rintaro|What could be the reason for the character limit?
Mayuri|Um...
Mayuri|Chicken and bananas become ’gelchicken’ and ’gelbanas’, but salt doesn’t turn into ’gelsalt’, right?
Itaru|So much gel...
Mayuri|And you can send 36 letters in a D-Mail, but everything past that disappears, right-?
Mayuri|So I think maybe you can’t send big things, or a lot of small things.
Mayuri|Maybe the Curb black hole--
Kurisu|Uh, it’s Kerr black hole.
Mayuri|The Curb black hole--
Kurisu|Kerr black hole.
Mayuri|...the black hole’s hole is too tight.
Itaru|Mayu-shi... say that one more time. Starting from ’hole’.
Mayuri|The hole is too tight!
Itaru|Outrageous!
Rintaro|Stop making her say stuff like that!
Kurisu|The hole is tight... huh. That might not be entirely wrong.
Kurisu|Maybe we have the same problem SERN has with their time machine. Since they can’t fully control the lifter, they can’t make the singularities perfectly naked, which limits how much they can send.
Itaru|Anyway, 6 Japanese or 12 English characters comes out to 12 bytes.
Kurisu|Bytes? Not kilobytes?
Itaru|Oh? So Makise-shi’s bad with computers?
Rintaro|Heh. Is that so, assistant?
Kurisu|Sh-shut up! You don’t see things measured in bytes nowadays, so I was just making sure...
Itaru|Well, email isn’t just comprised of text. There’s more to it, like the sender and receiver’s email addresses, the header, and various other things.
Itaru|So roughly speaking, we can send data in three batches of 12 bytes, then? By the way, I don’t know if using a subject changes anything.
Rintaro|But I’m pretty sure that chicken and bananas have to be larger than 12 bytes.
Rintaro|Since each grain of salt is tiny, it’s possible they could be converted to less than 12 bytes.
Kurisu|So larger masses get crushed by supergravity?
Rintaro|Mass might not be the issue here. Data doesn’t have mass.
Kurisu|In any case, since the singularity isn’t naked, the object is forced to pass through the event horizon.
Kurisu|Inside the event horizon, space and time switch places, causing the subject that arrived at the ring singularity to reach ultra high speed...
Kurisu|The data, crushed and destroyed by super gravity, is shot out of the black hole...
Rintaro|As a jellyman.
Kurisu|But even a small mass has to pass through supergravity. How does it emerge unscathed?
Rintaro|If the hole is too tight, then just inject more electrons.
Kurisu|I don’t think it’s that simple. I mean, I’m sure SERN’s tried that already. And yet they haven’t gotten any results after nine years of experiments.
Kurisu|It’s not as simple as increasing the flow of electrons.
Rintaro|I see...
Kurisu|SERN has a lifter, but we don’t know what in the PhoneWave is filling the same role, much less how to adjust it.
Rintaro|We don’t know what acts as the lifter...
Rintaro|But we do know that it has successfully created a path wide enough to send approximately 36 bytes of data through the ring singularity.
Mayuri|I don’t get it...
Rintaro|Think of it like an RPG. The ring singularity, the entrance to the event horizon, is the gate to the Demon Lord’s castle.
Kurisu|D-demon Lord...?
Mayuri|So the soldiers who went home as slimes are jellymen?
Rintaro|But there’s an exception.
Itaru|Combining soldiers? That’s just silly.
Rintaro|It’s to illustrate that the object can’t be too big.
Mayuri|I get it! That’s really easy to understand.
Kurisu|It is?
Itaru|It’s a dumb metaphor, but I guess it works? At least as an explanation for why things get gelified.
Rintaro|Heh. It’s all thanks to Mayuri’s hint.
Mayuri|Mayushii was helpful?
Rintaro|Yeah. Great insight, Mayuri.
Mayuri|Ehehe! Yay!
Kurisu|But it’s still a hypothesis. It hasn’t been proven.
Itaru|How would you prove it? With human experiments like SERN?
Kurisu|If Okabe and Hashida-san volunteer as test subjects, I’ll happily experiment on you.
Itaru|Human experimentation sounds kinda dirty. If you know what I mean.
Itaru|But I refuse. I’d rather play the doctor than the subject.
Rintaro|Same here. No, not in the way he’s implying.
Kurisu|Idiots.
Kurisu|As I keep saying, the real problem is what the PhoneWave uses as a lifter.
Rintaro|That and one other thing. How come the discharge phenomenon and gelification only happen during a certain timeframe?
Itaru|We may not understand everything, but we’ve perfected the art of D-Mailing. Isn’t that our Final Answer?
Mayuri|Sending mail to the past is amazing, isn’t it?
Itaru|Though I guess it’s not a real time machine unless we can send people to the past.
Kurisu|Even SERN has failed to send humans through. If you believe what Titor says, it won’t be another, what, 24 years before there’s a true time machine?
Rintaro|Physical time travel is impossible for us at the moment. We lack the funds and facilities available to SERN.
Rintaro|And yet we have realized a form of time travel. We’ve sent data to the past.
Kurisu|We should investigate the PhoneWave further. We need to understand what’s going on.
Itaru|I have some fun ideas for how to use D-Mail.
Rintaro|I know how you feel, but we can’t today. If we shake the building again, Mister Braun is sure to blow a gasket.
Rintaro|We can start experimenting again tomorrow. But this, I will declare now.
Mayuri|You have to take off your shoes. It’s dirty!
Rintaro|Today -- uhh, what day is it?
Itaru|August 2nd.
Rintaro|August 2nd, 2010 is a date which will live in infamy!
Rintaro|For on this day, we, the Future Gadget Laboratory, have developed--
Rintaro|The first successful time machine in the history of mankind!
Itaru|It’s not the first. SERN beat us.
Kurisu|And you can’t even say we developed it. It happened by accident.
Rintaro|Hmph! It seems that my assistant doesn’t know the meaning of the word ’serendipity’. Penicillin, X-ray machines, dynamite -- these inventions and more were all born from coincidence!
Kurisu|I guess...
Mayuri|But Chris-chan, you said before that time machines don’t exist, right? But now you admit they do!
Kurisu|It’s just that I have to admit it for now. If we investigate how the PhoneWave works, it might turn out to be something that only seems like time travel.
Rintaro|Does nobody have any respect for my grand declaration!?
Rintaro|Don’t complain if I take all the credit for inventing the first -- second, whatever -- time machine in human history!
Rintaro|The 66th Round Table Conference ends here. Dismissed!
Itaru|Wait, that was a Round Table Conference? I didn’t know that. And it’s even the 66th.
Kurisu|Who cares what kind of table it is?
Kurisu|I’m gonna go back to my hotel, take a shower, and sleep.
Mayuri|Mayushii has to go to work soon.
Rintaro|Nn... ugh...?
Moeka|Ah...
Rintaro|I was asleep.
Moeka|...
Moeka|...You’re covered in sweat.
Rintaro|Heh. I just had a little taste of what it’s like to be a particle drifting through space.
Rintaro|So you came to see the IBN 5100?
Rintaro|I can show you... but did you have to come so early?
Rintaro|Wait... I get it! Your true intention is to do an article on me, isn’t it!?
Moeka|...
Rintaro|I’m not reading it.
Rintaro|I’d feel like an idiot exchanging emails when you’re standing right in front of me.
Rintaro|Speak.
Moeka|...
Moeka|...Is it okay?
Rintaro|Is what okay?
Moeka|Please show me... the IBN 5100.
Rintaro|Fine. But just look. After you look, you leave. Okay?
Rintaro|It’s in that cardboard box over there.
Moeka|...Ah!
Rintaro|No unauthorized photographs. First, show me the camera you’re going to use.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Just place the camera you’re going to use on that shelf so I can see it. Okay? No funny business.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|...That’s it? You’re going to use your phone camera?
Moeka|...
Moeka|...Mail.
Rintaro|Speak.
Rintaro|H-hey! What are you doing!?
Rintaro|Don’t move! Do as I say. Place your phone slowly on the shelf inside. Do it now! Any sudden movements and you’re dead!
Rintaro|Why did you take a picture?
Moeka|...I wanted to.
Rintaro|You could’ve asked for permission. Why didn’t you?
Moeka|I asked... by mail.
Rintaro|Oh... You really need to learn to talk.
Rintaro|Alright. You can take as many pictures as you want, but on one condition. No face shots. If you take a picture of me, I’ll have no choice but to silence you.
Moeka|I don’t want your picture.
Rintaro|...Oh.
Rintaro|I already said no.
Rintaro|Besides, that thing weighs a ton. You can’t carry it by yourself.
Rintaro|Wait a minute!
Rintaro|Why are you assuming I’ll lend it to you!? I already said I wouldn’t!
Moeka|...Really?
Rintaro|Really.
Moeka|...No matter what?
Rintaro|No matter what.
Rintaro|...
Moeka|...Ugh!
Rintaro|Hey! Hold it right there!
Rintaro|What are you doing!?
Moeka|...Taking it home.
Rintaro|Like hell you are! Who said you could!?
Moeka|You... didn’t reply to my mail.
Rintaro|What?
Rintaro|No! That argument’s just irrational!
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Step away from the machine.
Rintaro|Now listen well.
Rintaro|The phantom retro PC, the IBN 5100, has chosen me, Hououin Kyouma, as its contractual master.
Rintaro|That’s the undeniable truth. Not even God can change this decision. For it is the choice of Steins Gate!
Rintaro|Besides, I’m only borrowing the IBN 5100’s power. When I’m done with it, I’m returning it to its original owner.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|I can’t tell you. I swore a blood oath to maintain secrecy and protect the original owner from those who desire the IBN 5100.
Rintaro|...I am not without sympathy for your plight.
Rintaro|I formed a contract with the IBN 5100 for my own goals. After I achieve those goals, you can negotiate with the original owner to form a contract of your own.
Rintaro|And when Ragnarok is over, whether it ends in victory or defeat, my life as Hououin Kyouma will be...
Rintaro|No, forget what I said. This is no time to be thinking about the future. After all, my future is already...
Moeka|Anyway... where was it?
Rintaro|The IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine.
Itaru|...Guten Morgen.
Rintaro|You sure are early.
Itaru|I went to bed early. Woke up at five this morning.
Itaru|Man, it’s hot! It’s not supposed to be this hot in the morning.
Itaru|Oh? Oh? Okarin, who’s this erot... sexy 3D woman?
Rintaro|Ah, let me introduce you. This is Shining Finger, Kiryu Moeka.
Itaru|Shining... Finger? Does her hand glow with an awesome power?
Rintaro|No, but she’s definitely an esper.
Itaru|An esper? That’s stupid.
Rintaro|Watch her type. You’ll see.
Itaru|Well, whatever. Welcome to the lab, Kiryu-shi.
Moeka|...
Itaru|Wh-what magnificent ignore skill. Are you looking down on me because I’m a fatass ota? You’re a mainstream woman, aren’t you!?
Rintaro|Um, Moeka, this is my Favorite Right Arm, Super Hacka Daru--
Moeka|...
Itaru|Hey, Okarin. Did you... do something to her?
Rintaro|Like what? We were just taking pictures.
Itaru|Pictures... pictures? So you’re going to blackmail her and force her to be our sex toy...
Rintaro|Stop applying eroge logic to reality.
Itaru|My bad.
Itaru|Oh, right. I thought up some upgrades we could make to the PhoneWave.
Rintaro|Like what?
Itaru|You know how it’s a huge pain in the ass to send D-Mails to the past?
Rintaro|Yeah.
Itaru|I want to simplify that process. Oh, and also make it possible to forward from the PhoneWave’s dedicated phone.
Rintaro|Forward? What do you mean?
Itaru|Right now, you can only send a D-Mail to the phone attached to the PhoneWave, right?
Itaru|That’s pretty inconvenient. If we give the PhoneWave’s dedicated phone a forwarding function, we can use it to send D-Mails to any number we want.
Rintaro|How long will that upgrade take?
Itaru|Two or three hours? That’s if you help me, though.
Rintaro|Understood. I’ll help.
Itaru|OK.
Rintaro|...
Moeka|...
Rintaro|If you want to say something, then say it to my--
Moeka|...
Moeka|...Read the email.
Rintaro|Say it to my--
Moeka|Sending email to the past.
Rintaro|...!
Moeka|That’s what he said.
Moeka|...Tell me.
Rintaro|You misheard us.
Moeka|No.
Moeka|I know what I heard.
Rintaro|It’s me. There’s a problem. ...No, not that. Information on Number 8 got leaked to a third party. ...Yeah, I know. I need to do something.
Rintaro|Depending on the situation, I may have to silence her. ...Yeah, I know. We can’t let the Organization know about this.
Rintaro|Steins Gate seems to enjoy sending trouble my way. ...Heh, don’t worry. My seat in hell can wait until Ragnarok is over.
Rintaro|El Psy Kongroo.
Moeka|...Who was that?
Rintaro|It doesn’t concern you.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Kiryu Moeka. You must swear to protect our secret... or die.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Choose now. No time to think it over. No alternatives either.
Rintaro|You have learned our secret, and now you must pay the price.
Moeka|...You’ll kill me?
Rintaro|Only if you try to go public. Underestimate the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, at your per--
Itaru|Are you at it again, Okarin?
Itaru|Kiryu-shi, was it? Okarin’s kind of crazy, so it’s ok to ignore him when he talks like this.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Imbecile! Because of your careless tongue, she found out that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is a time machine!
Moeka|A... time machine!
Itaru|Uh, that was pretty careless too.
Rintaro|Guh...
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Good morning!
Mayuri|Okarin! Mayushii wants to warm up some chicken before you start the time travel experiments.
Rintaro|Kiryu Moeka. I’ll tell you everything... and I have a favor to ask.
Rintaro|Tremble, right arm of mine! By the covenant I command thee. Come forth, hellfire of darkest black! Fulfill my desire for ultimate destruction. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust!
Rintaro|Hrraahm!!
Mayuri|Ahhh! Now I can’t warm up any more chicken...
Rintaro|This isn’t a microwave anymore. It’s a time machine.
Mayuri|That’s not fair! Go buy a new microwave, Okarin!
Rintaro|I don’t have that kind of money!
Moeka|...
Rintaro|I told you no pictures.
Moeka|...In commemoration.
Rintaro|Of what? Anyway, no pictures.
Rintaro|Kuh... I’ve gone soft. The old me would have killed her without a second thought.
Rintaro|What is it?
Moeka|...Is it really a time machine?
Rintaro|Yes. You’ll see. But you can’t tell anyone. Okay?
Itaru|Alright, program complete.
Kurisu|Then lets resume the experiments.
Mayuri|But won’t the manager scold us again?
Rintaro|Heh, don’t worry. Yesterday, I made this promise with Mister Braun. ’I swear there won’t be any more shaking today.’
Rintaro|In other words, the no-shaking promise only applied yesterday, so since today is yesterday’s tomorrow, we can shake it all we want!
Kurisu|That doesn’t settle anything. Why you’re so confident is a mystery to me.
Rintaro|In other words, Christina, you want me to erase Mister Braun.
Kurisu|No!
Kurisu|Besides, I don’t think a wimp like you stands a chance against him.
Mayuri|He’s so muscley!
Rintaro|Is this the choice of Steins Gate? But how do I...
Rintaro|Hm?
Rintaro|Hey you! Part-Time Warrior!
Suzuha|Sup!
Rintaro|What are you doing there?
Suzuha|Can’t you tell? I’m polishing my bicycle!
Rintaro|Aren’t you working today?
Suzuha|Of course I am. Why else would I be here?
Kurisu|What, is she still tinkering with that bike of hers?
Kurisu|She was there when I came in, glaring at me.
Rintaro|Hey, Part-Time Warrior! Where’s Mister Braun?
Suzuha|Mister Braun? Who’s that?
Rintaro|The manager of that junk shop you work at.
Kurisu|It’s not a junk shop. It’s a CRT specialty shop.
Suzuha|Oh, so that’s who you meant. Ahaha.
Nae|Daddy’s name isn’t Mister Braun.
Suzuha|The boss is on a service trip! I don’t think he’ll be back for a while!
Rintaro|Wh-what!? Is that true!?
Suzuha|It’s true! I wouldn’t be slacking off like this otherwise!
Suzuha|Ah, Nae, don’t tell the boss I said that, okay?
Nae|Then let me ride your bicycle.
Rintaro|You heard her. This must be the choice of Steins Gate.
Rintaro|Mister Braun is currently absent. In other words, we can experiment to our heart’s content!
Kurisu|That doesn’t solve the problem, you know.
Rintaro|I’m telling you, it’s the choice of Steins Gate.
Itaru|Whatever. I want to try out the PhoneWave 2nd Edition v1.03.
Mayuri|Second attention verse erosion?
Itaru|2nd Edition v1.03.
Rintaro|Enough of your unsophisticated names. The upgraded version shall be known as Heavenly Merry-Go-Round.
Kurisu|The name doesn’t matter. Let’s just start the experi--
Moeka|...You looked like you were having fun.
Kurisu|Hardly. I’m fed up with these people and their fooling around.
Itaru|This assistant is such a tsundere.
Kurisu|Who are you calling a tsundere!?
Itaru|Oh? Makise-shi, you know what tsundere means?
Kurisu|...N-no.
Rintaro|I think you do. It’s written all over your face.
Kurisu|Mmmgh...
Moeka|...Experiment please.
Itaru|I’m setting it up so it forwards to Okarin’s phone.
Moeka|It really...
Rintaro|What do you think? This proves that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is an honest-to-goodness time machine.
Moeka|...
Suzuha|Hey!
Suzuha|It’s shaking again! And there’s a strange light, too! What are you doing up there!?
Rintaro|Now then, lab mems.
Rintaro|The 73rd Round Table Conference will come to order.
Kurisu|Yesterday was the 66th. Where’d the other six go?
Rintaro|Only anal retentive bastards care about the minor details. That’s why you’ll never be more than an assistant, Christina!
Kurisu|Like I keep saying, I’m neither your assistant nor Christina.
Rintaro|In the first stage of Operation Urd, we tested the limits of D-Mail technology.
Rintaro|Today, we advance to the second stage. Practical applications of D-Mail.
Mayuri|Practical applications? I’ll send one to this morning so I can say ’Good morning, Okarin♪’
Rintaro|Like hell you will. Write that on the back of a leaflet or something.
Mayuri|But if it’s on the back of a leaflet, you won’t get it.
Rintaro|When I say practical applications, what I mean is...
Rintaro|Changing the past.
Kurisu|Now hold on! It’s too dangerous! Are you trying to play god!?
Rintaro|Oh? What’s so dangerous about it?
Kurisu|Let’s say you create a time paradox and blow up the world. What do you plan to do then?
Rintaro|Well, I guess we’d be dead.
Kurisu|You’re going to change the past so recklessly? Are you kidding me?
Kurisu|Don’t tell me... you’re not seriously trying to bring chaos to the world or whatever, are you?
Itaru|Nah, he’s all talk. It’s fine to ignore him, Makise-shi.
Kurisu|R-really?
Mayuri|Don’t worry! Okarin’s actually a very nice person. You’ll see!
Rintaro|I don’t remember asking for an appraisal, but I’ll answer Christina’s question.
Rintaro|My dream is to plunge the world into chaos. However, it is still far too early to bring that dream to fruition.
Rintaro|We can only send 36-byte emails. That’s not enough for my purposes.
Rintaro|Therefore, I shall set my ambition -- Project Chaotic -- aside for now.
Moeka|Project... Chaotic?
Kurisu|Did you just come up with that?
Itaru|Correct, Makise-shi!
Kurisu|YES.
Itaru|Okarin just says the first thing that comes to mind. He’s always like that.
Rintaro|Don’t analyze me, Daru! And you, assistant! Stop that fist pumping! You making fun of me!?
Mayuri|Um, so what are we going to do?
Itaru|Yeah. How do you want to change the past, anyway?
Rintaro|First of all, the purpose of this experiment is to verify whether or not we can actually change the past. So it doesn’t matter how trivial the change is.
Kurisu|Have you heard of the Butterfly Effect?
Rintaro|Of course.
Itaru|Yeah, it’s like that saying. ’When the wind blows, the bucket maker gains.’
Kurisu|Eh? No, it’s kinda like that, but kinda not...
Rintaro|A butterfly flaps its wings in Beijing and a storm happens in New York, right?
Kurisu|Yeah, that. Part of Chaos Theory.
Kurisu|Basically, any change, no matter how small, could have a significant effect on the future.
Kurisu|How do you plan to take responsibility for that?
Rintaro|Titor said that the many-worlds interpretation holds true.
Kurisu|And that makes it okay to change the past? You’re going to believe that self-proclaimed time traveler’s delusions?
Rintaro|Can you prove they’re delusions?
Kurisu|I’m asking what you’re going to do if they are. How are you going to deal with the consequences?
Rintaro|Christina, you said this before, did you not?
Rintaro|When hypotheses pile up, and theories are verified, they become reality. That’s how modern physics comes to understand the truth of the universe.
Rintaro|You’re contradicting yourself.
Kurisu|No, I’m not.
Kurisu|We don’t even have a hypothesis for how the PhoneWave works.
Kurisu|We’re just fumbling around in the dark here. There are still too many risks to try changing the past.
Kurisu|We should wait until we know more.
Rintaro|You’re actually itching to try it out, aren’t you?
Kurisu|W-well...
Rintaro|Besides, didn’t you want to prove that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) isn’t a time machine?
Rintaro|If it’s not a time machine, then it can’t change the past. You could prove yourself right, so why are you against it?
Kurisu|Oh shut up...
Rintaro|And if you’re going to talk about time paradoxes, then what about SERN?
Rintaro|They’ve already sent more than 100 people to the past. Surely a few paradoxes have happened by now.
Kurisu|So you want to stoop to the same level as the guys that did those inhumane experiments?
Rintaro|We’re not doing human testing or anything, so relax.
Mayuri|Um...
Mayuri|Um, Okarin? Mayushii doesn’t really get it, but what are you going to change?
Rintaro|My goal for this operation is simple. We, my friends...
Rintaro|Are going to win the lottery!
Itaru|I’m for it. If we win the lottery, I can buy all the computer parts I want and go to MayQueen for every meal of the day. We’d be stupid not to try it.
Mayuri|Money? Okarin... that makes Mayushii sad.
Mayuri|We should do something that will bring peace to the world!
Mayuri|Like what if we give everybody in the whole wide world an Upa cushion?
Rintaro|Hmph. Peace, you say? Don’t be ridiculous.
Rintaro|I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyo--
Kurisu|And here I thought you had ambition.
Rintaro|Don’t get me wrong.
Rintaro|This isn’t about world peace and it isn’t about ambition. It’s about discovering whether or not we can change the past.
Rintaro|The easiest way to do that is to see if we can win the lottery, right?
Kurisu|But your primary goal is the money, isn’t it?
Rintaro|With that kind of money, I could say goodbye to this rickety old building! Muhahaha! I could get an office in Daibiru or UPX!
Kurisu|See? Just like I thought.
Rintaro|I won’t whitewash it. If we moved, we could experiment as much as we want without fear of Mister Braun. If we had money, we could build the Future Gadgets of our dreams.
Rintaro|And of course, we could buy a truckload of Mayuri’s favorite bananas.
Mayuri|A t-truckload?
Kurisu|No, Mayuri-san! Don’t let him tempt you!
Rintaro|Shut it, Celeb Seventeen!
Kurisu|S-se...? Serendipity?
Rintaro|Celeb. Seventeen.
Kurisu|What the hell is that supposed to mean!?
Rintaro|You live in a hotel off of your parents’ money. You could never understand the plight of poor students like us.
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|What do you think, Moeka-san?
Moeka|...
Kurisu|Um...?
Rintaro|If you’re going to complain, then suggest an alternative. A change to the past that would be both trivial and easy to understand. Got anything?
Kurisu|Um...
Mayuri|Hmm?
Kurisu|Let’s try changing the hotel I’m staying at.
Rintaro|How are we supposed to know the difference? If you want to stay in Uguisudani, do it on your own. That should be easy for a Celeb Seventeen like you.
Kurisu|Do you have to say it like that?
Itaru|Anyway, why Uguisudani?
Rintaro|Because that’s where all the love hotels ar--
Kurisu|One more word out of you and I excise your frontal lobe with a rusty scalpel.
Mayuri|Then how about we change my fried chicken to a different brand?
Rintaro|Nobody cares what brand of chicken you eat.
Mayuri|Aw...
Rintaro|Even with a time machine before you all, this is all you can think of. You guys sure lack imagination.
Rintaro|If there are no other suggestions, we’ll use my plan.
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|It’s me. We’re beginning stage two of Operation Urd.
Rintaro|Yeah, no problem. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall take all responsibility. Heh, don’t worry. Nothing will come back to you.
Rintaro|Correct. This is my choice, and the choice of Steins Gate. Ragnarok is near. El Psy Kongroo.
Rintaro|Now, begin the operation!
Itaru|Uh, what do you want us to do?
Rintaro|Are you incapable of doing anything without my instructions?
Mayuri|First, we need to buy a lottery ticket.
Kurisu|No, first we need a winning number.
Rintaro|Exactly, Celeb Seventeen! Now you’re talking.
Kurisu|Don’t call me Celeb Seventeen.
Itaru|First, we have to decide which lottery to go for. Think we should go for Dream Summer Jumbo?
Mayuri|I saw a TV commercial for that the other day!
Rintaro|Did they announce the winners?
Itaru|Should be next week or the week after.
Rintaro|Then there’s no point! We can only send D-Mails to the past!
Itaru|Oh, right.
Itaru|We could wait until the Summer Jumbo drawing date.
Rintaro|You’ve got your priorities backwards. Don’t get fixated on Summer Jumbo. Let’s look at the last lottery that announced its winners.
Itaru|Hmmm, I’ll google it.
Kurisu|If someone sent me the winning numbers from the future, would I believe it?
Mayuri|Um, Mayushii doesn’t even know how to buy a lottery ticket...
Kurisu|That’s okay. I don’t think teenage girls buy lottery tickets.
Rintaro|Have you ever bought one, Moeka?
Mayuri|How about you, Okarin?
Rintaro|...I tried the LOTO SIX once.
Itaru|Hey, LOTO SIX might work. I’m pretty sure they announce winning numbers every week.
Mayuri|Are you going to send this winning number in a D-Mail?
Rintaro|Exactly. Though of course, we have to mention it’s for LOTO SIX.
Itaru|Hmm, last week’s 1st prize was... woah, 200 million!
Rintaro|W-wait! 1st prize is too much!
Itaru|Why?
Kurisu|That is an awful lot of money... hahaha...
Rintaro|No, not that. 1st place would be... too conspicuous.
Kurisu|What?
Rintaro|Don’t you get it!? I’m being chased by the Organization. If we win 1st prize, the media will cover the event and my cover will be blown!
Kurisu|That’s stupid.
Mayuri|What if Mayushii wins?
Rintaro|No. Stage Two of Operation Urd does have its risks, just like Celeb Sev said.
Kurisu|Celeb... Sev? Don’t abbreviate it.
Rintaro|I’ll be the winner. That way, I shoulder all of the risk.
Kurisu|And all of the money, right? I see your plan.
Rintaro|Anyway, we should aim a little lower. Daru, how much is 2nd prize?
Itaru|Umm, looks like it was... 23 million yen.
Rintaro|...L-let’s try 3rd prize.
Itaru|That was only 700,000 yen.
Rintaro|Yeah, that’s good. That should be about right.
Kurisu|You’re such a chicken.
Rintaro|Heh, heh heh heh! That’s rich, coming from the one who was so worried about the risk of time paradoxes. Eh, Celeb Sev!?
Kurisu|I’m begging you, stop calling me that. I’ll settle for assistant.
Kurisu|And don’t misunderstand. I’m still worried about what could go wrong.
Rintaro|I’m trying to minimize our risk by choosing an amount that’s just right. Stop being so stubborn.
Kurisu|...No, you.
Mayuri|Um, could we fill a truckload of bananas with 700,000 yen?
Itaru|For 3rd prize, you need to get five matching numbers.
Rintaro|Moeka. I assign to you your first duty as a new lab mem.
Moeka|Eh...?
Rintaro|Figure out what to put in the D-Mail. It needs to convince an unknowing me one week ago to buy into the LOTO SIX.
Moeka|...Me?
Rintaro|You are the mail demon, so this should be right up your alley.
Moeka|...
Kurisu|Thursday last week... so about five days. Is that okay?
Itaru|The drawing was five days ago. It needs to arrive before that, right?
Kurisu|We’ll send it to one week ago. 7 days is 168 hours, so let’s round up a bit and enter 170#.
Mayuri|Ummm, 1, 7, 0, #...
Rintaro|It’ll have to do.
Mayuri|This mail’s kinda shady, huh? Ehehe!
Moeka|...I’ll redo it.
Rintaro|It’s fine. I don’t think there’s any other way. Though it is kind of shady.
Mayuri|Don’t worry! Okarin loves shady things, so it’s perfect!
Rintaro|The time has come. Prepare to open Steins Gate!
Kurisu|It’s been bugging me, but what is that Steins Gate thing?
Mayuri|It’s Okarin’s catch phrase♪
Rintaro|Steins Gate is Steins Gate. Nothing more, nothing less.
Kurisu|That doesn’t explain anything.
Rintaro|Don’t complain about every little thing. That’s not important right now.
Itaru|Starting up the microwave!
Rintaro|El Psy Kongroo!
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Okarin? Are you okay?
Rintaro|...!
Mayuri|Are you okay?
Itaru|Hmm...
Rintaro|Mayuri, how long have I been standing here?
Mayuri|Eh? What do you mean?
Rintaro|Just tell me.
Mayuri|Hm... maybe 30 seconds?
Rintaro|30 seconds? Really?
Mayuri|Yup. You suddenly ran over to the PhoneWave, then you took out your phone and started going ’haaah haaah!
Itaru|Say that again, Mayushii.
Mayuri|Huh? You started going haah haah?
Itaru|The haah haah part!
Mayuri|Haah haah!
Itaru|More sexy this time!
Kurisu|Stop it, perv.
Rintaro|Th-that’s right, the mail!
Rintaro|The mail arrived a week ago.
Mayuri|Hm? What’s going on?
Rintaro|The money! Did I win the LOTO SIX?
Rintaro|Hey, Celeb Sev, did I win 3rd place?
Kurisu|Don’t call me Celeb Sev! And 3rd place of what?
Rintaro|...what?
Rintaro|What did you say just now?
Kurisu|Wh-what?
Rintaro|What the hell did you say just now!?
Kurisu|Got a problem? I asked what, and then you just--
Rintaro|Not that! You said ’3rd place of what’, right!? I mean 3rd place of LOTO SIX!
Kurisu|What?
Rintaro|Daru! I sent myself the winning LOTO SIX numbers just now. Didn’t I?
Itaru|Holy crap!
Itaru|That’s brilliant, man! We can use D-Mails to make ourselves billionaires!
Itaru|I could buy all the computer parts I want and go to MayQueen for every meal of the day! I AM SO PUMPED UP!
Rintaro|Mayuri, you were gonna buy a truckload of bananas... right?
Mayuri|A truckload? Who’s gonna fill it up?
Rintaro|Wait! What happened to stage two of Operation Urd!?
Kurisu|By stage two, you mean an experiment to see if we can change the past, right?
Rintaro|R-right! That’s it!
Itaru|Yeah, that’s why we’re all thinking.
Rintaro|What?
Mayuri|About what to send, so we can tell if the past has changed.
Itaru|I think we should definitely go with Okarin’s LOTO SIX idea.
Mayuri|Mayushii thinks we shouldn’t be so greedy for dough.
Mayuri|Ah, but when I say dough, I don’t mean like for baking.
Kurisu|I think we all know what you mean.
Mayuri|Really? That’s great! So, instead of being greedy, we should do something that will bring peace to the world!
Mayuri|Like, if we gave everybody in the whole wide world an Upa cushion, I think everyone would be happy♪
Itaru|The only ones who’d be happy are little kids and Mayu-shi.
Luka|Um... hello?
Mayuri|Ah, it’s Luka-kun! Welcome♪
Luka|Pardon the sudden intrusion...
Mayuri|Did you decide to wear one of Mayushii’s costumes? That would make me happy♪
Luka|Ah, no, that’s not why I came...
Rintaro|...What is it?
Luka|Actually, Okabe-san... I mean, Kyouma-san, there’s something I need to apologize for...
Rintaro|Ah...!
Rintaro|Where did you get this!?
Luka|T-that hurts...
Mayuri|Don’t pick on Luka-kun!
Kurisu|What’s wrong with you, Okabe? You’re acting weird.
Itaru|Is the heat getting to him?
Rintaro|Sorry, Lukako, but I need to know. Where did you get that LOTO SIX ticket?
Luka|Um... you told me the numbers.
Rintaro|I... did?
Luka|You told me to buy them because they might win...
Rintaro|R-really? When was that!?
Luka|A week ago...
Itaru|Wait, did Luka-shi win the LOTO SIX?
Mayuri|Wow! Okarin’s a psychic!
Moeka|...
Kurisu|Don’t tell me... you sent the winning numbers with the PhoneWave?
Rintaro|Why are you asking me that? You saw me send them.
Kurisu|I did? What are you talking about?
Rintaro|I sent the winning numbers in a D-Mail just now. We discussed it and decided that’s what we would do. You all watched it happen.
Rintaro|Then the past changed. It actually changed.
Itaru|Hold on, Luka-shi! How much did you win!?
Rintaro|700,000, right? 3rd place.
Luka|Um...
Luka|I’m really sorry, Kyouma-san. Even though you told me exactly what to do, I...
Luka|Filled one of the numbers in wrong...
Luka|Um... if that ’18’ had been a ’19’, then it would’ve been 3rd place... just like Kyouma-san said.
Itaru|Nooo! So close! And yet so far!
Rintaro|...Huh? It’s gone! Why!?
Suzuha|Hey there, Okabe Rintaro.
Suzuha|You look like you’ve been brainwashed. You okay?
Rintaro|Brainwashed? Me?
Suzuha|Well, there’s nobody else here.
Rintaro|...I suppose you’re right.
Suzuha|Which part?
Suzuha|Being brainwashed? Or nobody else being here?
Rintaro|Being brainwashed.
Suzuha|You... were?
Rintaro|Nwohh!? Wh-wh-what are you doing!?
Suzuha|Don’t move.
Suzuha|You’re okay. You haven’t been brainwashed.
Rintaro|...What?
Suzuha|When you’re brainwashed, they usually put a chip on the inside of your lower eyelid.
Suzuha|Okabe Rintaro. Please keep that confidential.
Rintaro|So you’ve been captured by the Organization before. Just like me.
Suzuha|...Huh? The Organization? Are you talking about SERN?
Rintaro|No! Say no more. I understand your pain all too well.
Suzuha|Y-you do?
Rintaro|The Organization’s secret brainwashing facility, known as Apocalypse of Galient. That place is a living hell.
Rintaro|I don’t want to revive any suppressed memories.
Suzuha|Um, right. I don’t think it was called Apokawhatever, though...
Suzuha|But it certainly was a living hell.
Rintaro|I can tell you’ll make a good comrade, Part-Time Warrior. The day of Ragnarok is near!
Suzuha|C-cool!
Nae|Suzuha, what’s ’brain watching’?
Rintaro|Heh heh heh. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall be the one to answer that.
Nae|Eh!? No... that’s okay.
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|Ahaha! Looks like Nae’s afraid of you, Okabe Rintaro.
Rintaro|You do well to fear me, Sister Braun, but you should also pay me respect. For I am the world’s most infamous mad scientist!
Nae|You’re infamous?
Rintaro|Indeed. World leaders would kill to get their hands on my genius brain cells.
Nae|Wow...
Suzuha|That’s how people talk when they’ve been brainwashed, Nae.
Nae|Eh?
Rintaro|Nonsense, Part-Time Warrior. My brain has not been washed since the day I was born.
Nae|Are you a liar, Mister Okarin?
Rintaro|Don’t call me that!
Nae|...!
Suzuha|You shouldn’t yell at children. Look, she’s shaking.
Kurisu|You’re even more of a perv than Okabe! I’m not using ’-san’ for you any more!
Itaru|I’m not a perv! I’m a pervy gentleman!
Kurisu|What does that even mean!?
Mayuri|Hey, guys? Do you think Okarin’s okay?
Rintaro|You heard everything, didn’t you?
Suzuha|Sorry, sorry. I didn’t mean to eavesdrop, but I just couldn’t help it!
Rintaro|Did you hear about the time machine too?
Suzuha|Oh, yeah. I heard. Way to go, you!
Rintaro|You haven’t told anyone, have you? If I can’t trust you to keep silent, I’ll have to take extreme--
Suzuha|I won’t say a thing, I swear! Your secret’s safe with me!
Rintaro|Great. There’s just one thing I’d like to ask.
Rintaro|Did you see some kind of electrical discharge on the second floor just now?
Suzuha|Electrical discharge? You mean like yesterday’s rumbling?
Suzuha|It happened once before. You’re lucky the boss wasn’t around.
Nae|It shook. It was scary.
Rintaro|Just now, about a minute ago, it should’ve happened again.
Suzuha|Oh, really? I didn’t see the second time.
Suzuha|Maybe I was too preoccupied polishing my baby.
Suzuha|Did you see it, Nae?
Nae|Nope.
Rintaro|You didn’t see the second one?
Nae|I didn’t see it.
Suzuha|Did something happen?
Rintaro|...How much do you know about time travel?
Suzuha|...What do you mean by that?
Suzuha|...I don’t believe it.
Suzuha|I’ve never heard of anything like that. Is it true? Are you telling the truth?
Rintaro|Of course. We’ve created a bona-fide time machine. And we were able to change the past!
Rintaro|Nobody can deny our accomplishments. That’s right, nobody!
Suzuha|Geez! That’s not what I meant!
Suzuha|I don’t know if what you’re saying is true or not, but...
Suzuha|I think you should try asking John Titor.
Rintaro|...John Titor?
Suzuha|I mean, he’s a hot topic now, isn’t he? A time traveler from the future!
Suzuha|He might know something. Since you’re both time travelers and all.
Rintaro|I see... You could be right! No, there’s no doubt about it!
Rintaro|It’s me. John Titor may have come from the future to guide me.
Rintaro|Yeah, that’s right. His arrival here in 2010 must be the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo.
Nae|Who is he talking to?
Suzuha|Dunno. Who could it be? Maybe it’s someone from the future.
Nae|From the future...!
Rintaro|...Do you want to know who I’m talking to, Sister Braun?
Nae|N-no, I...
Rintaro|Good. Even if you are interested, never ask. I could tell you, but then I’d have to silence you. And I don’t want to have to do that to an innocent girl.
Nae|...!
Suzuha|Come on, stop scaring her. She’s just a little girl.
Rintaro|I’ll get in touch with Titor immediately. Your advice is appreciated, Part-Time Warrior!
Suzuha|Ahaha, was I useful? That’s gr--
Suzuha|Oh crap! The boss is back! The boss is back!
Suzuha|Nae, if Manager asks, tell him I was doing my job!
Nae|Okay. But you have to let me ride your bike, okay?
Suzuha|Okay, okay!
Suzuha|Good luck, Okabe Rintaro! I’m rooting for you!
Nae|Welcome back, Daddy!
Tennouji|Nae! What did this nutjob do to you!?
Tennouji|You son of a... how dare you make moves on my precious daughter!? I’ll kill ya!
Rintaro|W-wait! I haven’t done anything!
Tennouji|Then why were you talking with Nae alone, huh!?
Rintaro|We weren’t alone! Suzuha was here too! That girl was skipping work to polish her bicycle!
Tennouji|...Is that true, Nae?
Nae|She promised she’d let me ride her bike. So I gotta say she wasn’t skipping!
Tennouji|Skipping’s the only thing she’s good at, isn’t it? Worthless part-timer.
Rintaro|Anyway, shouldn’t you apologize for making false accusations?
Tennouji|What? Hell no!
Tennouji|Understand? I won’t let you off easy next time you make moves on my daughter.
Rintaro|I wouldn’t do something so suicidal.
Tennouji|Nae, I bought some cream puffs, so let’s eat them together.
Nae|Okay!
Tennouji|Hey, part-timer! I know you were slacking off! Hey!
Tennouji|And why is the 42-inch on!? I thought I told you to turn it off!
Suzuha|I’m sorryyyyy!
Rintaro|Wait! We’ll talk when everything’s over.
Mayuri|Um, I’ll buy more bananas tomorrow, okay?
Mayuri|So for now, hug this little guy suuuuper tight and cheer up, okay?
Rintaro|Hey, assistant. You’re not going back to your hotel?
Kurisu|Is there a problem?
Rintaro|No, no problem. I was just wondering what you were still doing here.
Kurisu|Nothing. I just wanted to think for a bit.
Rintaro|Can’t you think at your hotel?
Kurisu|What? You’re kicking me out?
Rintaro|Ahh, I get it. You’d be lonely in your hotel room, but you have no friends, so you want me, the great Hououin Kyouma, to look after you. Isn’t that right, you spoiled Celeb Sev?
Kurisu|You’re the lonely one, aren’t you? You’ve been acting gloomy all day.
Kurisu|Do you need some advice? I’m an outsider, in a sense, so it should be easier to talk to me, right?
Kurisu|A man getting advice from a younger woman is kind of *mumble mumble*, but if you’re fine with that, then just ask away.
Rintaro|I need to send some emails. If you insist on staying here, then be quiet and stay out of my way. Okay, Zombie?
Kurisu|Of all your stupid names, that one’s the worst.
Rintaro|Want some coffee?
Kurisu|Sure.
Kurisu|What’s wrong with you? Stop fidgeting.
Kurisu|That was a pretty heavy sigh.
Rintaro|Christina. There’s something I want to talk to you about.
Kurisu|Shouldn’t you answer your phone first?
Rintaro|It’s Daru. It’s probably something stupid.
Kurisu|You’re really self-righteous, you know.
Rintaro|You might not remember this, but earlier, I changed the past with a D-Mail.
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|...I haven’t known you long enough to tell whether you’re serious.
Rintaro|It happened. And then everyone except me forgot about it. Or rather, the fact that it happened was erased from history.
Kurisu|The past changed, so the present changed with it? The Butterfly Effect, huh. But what you’re saying is nonsense.
Rintaro|Why do you say that?
Kurisu|Why do you remember that the past changed?
Kurisu|If you used a time machine to physically travel to the past and change history, then that might explain it -- barely.
Kurisu|But with a D-Mail, you haven’t taken one step outside the present, have you?’
Kurisu|So if the present changed, and we changed with it, you would have to change too.
Kurisu|Or are you saying you didn’t change because you’re the observer? In that case, you’re claiming that you’re not a human being.
Rintaro|...Everything is the choice of Steins Gate! This is the power of my magic eye, Reading Steiner! Muhahaha!
Kurisu|Aaaand he’s at it again.
Kurisu|I’m not playing along with your games. I bet you came up with that Reading Whatever thing just now, didn’t you?
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Hello?
Itaru|Okarin! I’ve made a terrible mistake!
Rintaro|Mistake?
Itaru|Actually...
Itaru|I left my wallet at the lab.
Rintaro|Wh...at?
Itaru|I can’t go to MayQueen like this! Can you bring me my wallet? I’ll buy you a drink.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Go jump in the river!
Rintaro|Tch, persistent little...
Rintaro|Yeah? I’m not delivering your wallet, okay!?
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Okarin, Okarin!
Rintaro|Oh, it’s you. You’re with Daru, right? You don’t have to lend that dumbass any money, okay?
Mayuri|Um, okay♪
Mayuri|So, Okarin, I was wondering if you cheered up. Did you hug Upa like I said?
Rintaro|No! I am a mad scientist full of madness and ambition!
Mayuri|That’s good! You know, if you’re worried about anything, talk to Mayushii, okay? Mayushii doesn’t understand hard things, but she does understand Okarin♪
Rintaro|You understand me?
Mayuri|Sure! We’ve been together since we were little, after all. Ehehe!
Rintaro|...Hmph. I’m hanging up. Work hard now.
Mayuri|Thanks! Bye!
Rintaro|...Hmph, she thinks she knows me.
Kurisu|Okabe. You’re grinning.
Rintaro|...!!
Rintaro|N-nonsense, Celeb Sev!
Kurisu|Don’t call me Celeb Sev!
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|You look like a girl in love waiting for an email from her boyfriend.
Rintaro|Are you really that desperate for attention?
Kurisu|Just getting revenge. You’re always making fun of me, so I deserve at least this much.
Rintaro|Despite what you may think, I actually respect you.
Kurisu|That’s rich. You don’t even say my name right.
Rintaro|I’m sorry about that.
Kurisu|Well, that’s unexpected... You actually apologized.
Rintaro|I do apologize. But I can’t help it.
Rintaro|For my brain has recorded you as my assistant, Christina, and I cannot correct it! MUHAHAHAHA!
Kurisu|I’m gonna crack your skull open and stick electrodes in your hippocampus.
Kurisu|Who are you talking to?
Rintaro|John Titor.
Kurisu|Huh? No way.
Rintaro|He’s open to discussion as long as you’re not trying to troll him, and his mail address is public. This is the second time we’ve exchanged mails.
Kurisu|No wonder you keep referencing Titor’s posts. You believe him, don’t you?
Rintaro|Not entirely. But there are several points in his story I do agree with.
Kurisu|Really? I can’t see it as anything but fiction.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Muhahahahaha!
Kurisu|D-don’t just start laughing like that. It’s creepy.
Rintaro|Hehehe, but I must! He says I have powers! Isn’t that rich!?
Rintaro|You don’t have to tell me what I already know, John Titor!
Rintaro|My true power... is the magic eye, ’Reading Steiner’!
Kurisu|Sounds to me like you’ve got a bad case of chuunibyou.
Rintaro|Eh?
Kurisu|Eh...?
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|...Tch.
Rintaro|John Titor is a fraud!
Rintaro|Me, the Messiah? Hmph. Ludicrous! To think that I would save humanity!
Rintaro|I am no Messiah! I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, who has walked through fire and bathed in an ocean of blood to escape the clutches of the Organization!
Rintaro|My desire is chaos unending. Do you think that destroying the System will bring peace to the world? The answer is no! No, I say!
Rintaro|Death to the naive fools who believe such lies! The collapse of authority means that lawless CHAOS shall reign! MUHAHAHAHA!
Itaru|Um, Makise-shi? What the hell happened to Okarin?
Kurisu|Beats me. A few hours ago, he was exchanging emails with John Titor, and then he suddenly got quiet.
Kurisu|And then he started ranting. He’s been like this for half an hour.
Itaru|He’s been acting strange all day, don’t you think?
Kurisu|Agreed.
Rintaro|Listen up, lab mems! It’s time to resume Operation Urd!
Itaru|Seriously? The manager’s still downstairs, you know?
Rintaro|Fret not. It’s almost closing time for the Braun Tube Workshop.
Kurisu|The PhoneWave doesn’t work at night, remember?
Rintaro|It’s worth a try! We need to figure out how late the PhoneWave (name subject to change) works.
Rintaro|At the same time, I want to see if the two of you can use D-Mails to change the past.
Itaru|Change the past...!
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|Change the past to your liking. As long as it’s something easy to observe.
Kurisu|I’m going back to my hotel. Show me your report on today’s experiment tomorrow.
Rintaro|Hold it!
Kurisu|Hey! What’s your problem!?
Rintaro|Who’s writing that report?
Kurisu|You, of course. This is your operation.
Kurisu|And if we could get a report from the subject too, that would be even better.
Rintaro|...Are you not interested in changing the past? What happened to your eagerness to experiment?
Kurisu|Did you forget what I said this afternoon? I’m against it.
Rintaro|But you were so enthusiastic when we began the experiments. You went along without a single complaint.
Kurisu|In your dreams, maybe.
Rintaro|You’re not being objective, Christi... Celeb Sev.
Kurisu|If you’re going to correct yourself, at least get it right.
Rintaro|We’ve already performed one experiment. I changed the past.
Itaru|Hey! No fair!
Rintaro|Ah, but you were in on it too. But when the past changed, you forgot that it had ever happened.
Itaru|Are you talking about this afternoon? I mean, when you suddenly started asking about the LOTO SIX.
Rintaro|Exactly.
Itaru|...You’re not joking, are you?
Rintaro|I’m serious.
Itaru|...Seriously?
Itaru|Okay! There’s one thing about the past I definitely want to change.
Rintaro|What? Are you going to tell yourself to go on a diet?
Itaru|I wouldn’t diet even if future me told me to.
Rintaro|You’re gonna change the result?
Itaru|I remember every move Faris-tan made. It’ll be easy to take her from behind. Aren’t I a genius?
Rintaro|Whatever. Daru, prepare to D-Mail!
Itaru|Hell yeah! I’ll give it my best shot!
Kurisu|So why do you think you’re the only one who remembers?
Rintaro|You’re awfully persistent. I see why they call you The Zombie.
Kurisu|I don’t follow.
Rintaro|Zombies never stop coming. They’re persistent.
Kurisu|Cut the jokes. I’m serious here.
Rintaro|I think that the key is who receives the D-Mail.
Rintaro|Only the recipient himself is able to retain his memories. That would be my guess.
Kurisu|Hmmm...
Rintaro|After Daru, you’ll send the next D-Mail. Think about what you want to write.
Kurisu|No.
Kurisu|I’m not sending one.
Rintaro|Scared?
Kurisu|That’s not it.
Rintaro|Then are you worried about time paradoxes?
Kurisu|Well, there’s that, but it’s more like a personal policy.
Kurisu|Changing the past feels like cheating.
Kurisu|I may only have 18 years of life experience, but I don’t want to change any of those memories.
Rintaro|I see. You’re perfect now, so you don’t want to change.
Kurisu|That’s not what I said...
Kurisu|I don’t want to deny who I’ve been. Because even my failures are a part of who I am today.
Rintaro|Even if we solved all of the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s problems, you wouldn’t use it?
Rintaro|Even if John Titor said you could use his time machine to travel to whatever time you wish, you wouldn’t use it?
Rintaro|Even if a blue robot cat from the future were to jump out of your desk and give you a doorway to everywhere, you wouldn’t use it?
Kurisu|I wouldn’t.
Rintaro|But you love experiments. Don’t you?
Kurisu|S-something wrong with that?
Rintaro|So basically, you like to experiment on other people while you watch and cackle at the results! You truly are a mad scientist!
Kurisu|Why you--
Itaru|Done!
Kurisu|I don’t get it.
Itaru|It’s how Faris-tan placed her cards. Can’t you tell? You guys are lame.
Rintaro|Why do I remember?
Itaru|Did the past change?
Rintaro|Wait. Daru, you remember too?
Itaru|Huh? Remember what?
Rintaro|That you just sent a D-Mail!
Kurisu|Of course I remember. What are you...
Kurisu|Oh, I see. According to your hypothesis, you and I shouldn’t remember sending the D-Mail.
Rintaro|Daru, did you beat Faris in the Faris Cup?
Itaru|...I dunno.
Rintaro|You said the winner gets Faris’s home cooking, right? Did you eat it? What happened?
Itaru|I don’t know... This sucks.
Kurisu|...Maybe the past hasn’t changed?
Itaru|I’ll try calling Mayu-shi.
Itaru|Mayu-shi? You’re still at work, right? Is Faris-tan there? ...She is!?
Itaru|Um, can you ask her if I beat her in the Faris Cup? Did I get to eat her home cooking?
Itaru|...Who lost? I did? Oh... Barely took five seconds? Oh... okay...
Kurisu|I guess that means the past hasn’t changed.
Itaru|Why!? It changed for Okarin, right!?
Kurisu|Maybe your foolproof plan wasn’t so foolproof. Like, maybe it only gave you a slight advantage.
Kurisu|Since Faris-san defeated you anyway, the past didn’t change.
Itaru|Yeah, but I mean, the game would’ve played out differently.
Rintaro|That might not be enough to cause worldline divergence.
Kurisu|Like Okabe said, you need to make a change that’s easier to observe. Or else there’s no point to this experiment.
Kurisu|Um, n-not that I approve of this experiment or anything.
Itaru|No, it’s not over yet. I can still fight!
Itaru|One more time. I’ll try sending my past self some more advice. This time, something that’ll ensure my victory.
Kurisu|You really want to win that badly?
Rintaro|More like he wants to eat Faris’s home cooking that badly.
Itaru|That’s my Final Answer.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...
Itaru|...
Rintaro|Oh...?
Kurisu|...Out of time?
Rintaro|Looks like it.
Itaru|But my advice was perfect...
Rintaro|There’s nothing we can do about it. We’ll postpone the experiment till tomorrow.
Kurisu|After I left yesterday, I was thinking. How exactly does the PhoneWave make time travel possible?
Rintaro|It works like the LHC. Didn’t you say the LHC was like a giant microwave?
Kurisu|If every microwave could turn into the LHC, then Japan would have black holes popping up everywhere.
Itaru|Whoa, that sounds worse than earthquakes.
Kurisu|I know it looks like SERN is able to create Kerr black holes willy-nilly, but that’s not supposed to be possible.
Kurisu|You can’t just press a button and make a black hole. Even if you could, the risks would be unthinkable.
Kurisu|It’s ridiculous to suggest that a household microwave could generate a black hole.
Kurisu|My point is that there has to be something else going on here.
Kurisu|Some outside source must be injecting electrons into this microwave.
Kurisu|Well, I’m going back to my hotel. I’ve had enough of this filthy man cave.
Kurisu|See you tomorrow. Don’t forget to write that report.
Itaru|Hmm... Makise-shi’s lab coat... I wonder what it smells like...
Rintaro|Cut that out! If you have time to be perverted, then go think about how to change the past for tomorrow’s experiment!
Tennouji|Okabe! Don’t you have anything better to do?
Nae|Good morning, Mister Okarin.
Rintaro|How many times do I have to tell you? Call me Kyouma!
Nae|Um... what should I do, Daddy?
Tennouji|What nonsense are you trying to feed my daughter?
Rintaro|Have you not properly educated her, Mister Braun? This child of yours refuses to call me by my true name. Please do something about it.
Tennouji|Who cares? Don’t be so picky.
Tennouji|Nae, you don’t have to listen to what this guy says, okay?
Nae|Okay...
Nae|Ah.
Mayuri|Good morning, Okarin!
Nae|Mayuri!
Mayuri|Good morning, Nae-chan.
Nae|Good morning.
Mayuri|This is for you, Nae-chan. Enjoy♪
Nae|Thank you!
Mayuri|I have some for Okarin too!
Mayuri|Why are you sitting out here?
Rintaro|I’m waiting for all lab mems to assemble.
Nae|Um, are you slacking off?
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Um, Nae-chan? I’m sure Okarin’s thinking about important stuff.
Nae|Oh... wow!
Mayuri|Okarin, Okarin. It’s too early to make PhoneWave-chan sparkle, right?
Mayuri|Can I go nuke some yakisoba bread?
Rintaro|We removed the door. You can’t heat food in it anymore.
Mayuri|Oh, right. That makes me sad...
Mayuri|By the way, have you had breakfast?
Rintaro|Nope.
Mayuri|Then let’s eat together. We can eat the yakisoba bread cold, and then heat up some canned ramen in hot water.
Mayuri|Wanna join us, Nae-chan?
Nae|I’m okay. I ate.
Mayuri|Okay!
Mayuri|Daru-kun and Chris-chan are kinda late, huh?
Rintaro|Indeed. Their lack of dedication is appalling.
Suzuha|Sup!
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Suzu-san.
Suzuha|If it isn’t Shiina Mayuri! Tutturu♪
Suzuha|Okabe Rintaro, did you talk to Titor?
Rintaro|...Maybe.
Suzuha|Come on! You emailed him, didn’t you?
Rintaro|Yes, but I’m starting to doubt whether he can be trusted.
Suzuha|What!? Why!? What went wrong!?
Rintaro|Oh, so you’re a Titor otaku.
Mayuri|Look, it’s Chris-chan!
Mayuri|Chris-chan, tutturu♪
Kurisu|Good morning.
Rintaro|What did you say to the part-timer downstairs?
Kurisu|Nothing much. I told her if she wanted to say something, she should just say it.
Rintaro|What did she say?
Kurisu|Nothing. She just groaned. I wonder what’s wrong with her.
Itaru|She’s jealous of Makise-shi’s popularity, duh!
Itaru|She’s thinking ’If only I’d joined the lab instead of her. Then I would be having fun with everyone right now! I’m so jealous!’ or something like that.
Itaru|I’m telling you, man. 3D is hell.
Kurisu|If she wants my lab mem number, she can have it.
Rintaro|What!? The lab mem number you carry is the highest credential a scientist could hope to achieve! They sell for millions on the black market, but you would give it away!?
Kurisu|It’s not exactly a counterfeit passport. Also, shut up.
Mayuri|Mayushii wants everyone to get along.
Itaru|Anzai-sensei, I want to eat Faris-tan’s home cooking...
Mayuri|If you give up, it’s game over!
Rintaro|Mayuri, it’s time for you to change the past.
Mayuri|Eh? Me? Are you sure?
Mayuri|But, um... what should I change?
Mayuri|Oh, I know! I’ll make Luka-kun wear one of my costumes!
Rintaro|How?
Mayuri|By sending Luka-kun a mail! Ehehe!
Rintaro|Can’t you think of anything easier to change and observe?
Mayuri|Hmm...
Rintaro|...Let’s use that canned ramen.
Rintaro|You’ll send a D-Mail to yourself one hour ago. Type ’I wanna eat canned oden’ or something like that.
Kurisu|I don’t think that’s enough to convince her to--
Mayuri|Oh, that might work!
Kurisu|Eh...?
Mayuri|When I went to the vending machine today, I spent ten minutes wondering if I should get canned oden or canned ramen. It was really hard!
Rintaro|So a little push should be enough to make you choose canned oden! Alright, let’s go with that!
Mayuri|Okay! But before we change the past, I gotta finish this ramen first.
Kurisu|What happens if you don’t finish it?
Mayuri|It’ll go to waste♪
Kurisu|Oh... of course. Ahaha...
Rintaro|PhoneWave (name subject to change), activate!
Mayuri|Aw... I haven’t sent it yet...
Kurisu|So one second isn’t enough for the discharge to occur. That’s what I expected, but it’s good to have proof.
Itaru|What if you try warming it up beforehand?
Kurisu|Warming it up?
Itaru|One second isn’t enough, right? So just run the microwave for about 30 seconds without sending a mail.
Itaru|As soon as it’s done, run it again with the timer set at one second. That should cause the discharge, right?
Kurisu|Any basis for that?
Itaru|Nope.
Rintaro|Damn. Mayuri, got anything else!?
Mayuri|Um, well... we could change the flavor of rice ball I bought last night...
Rintaro|Do you remember what kind of rice ball you ate last night?
Mayuri|Smoked tuna.
Kurisu|She remembers!?
Mayuri|So let’s change that to, um... fish eggs!
Rintaro|What?
Rintaro|But wait...
Rintaro|It’s me. Yeah, I have some doubts. What? You can tell by my voice? Hmph, you know me too well.
Rintaro|So, about whether or not I should include Shining Finger in the PhoneWave (name subject to change) experiments...
Rintaro|...What? Nonsense. You want me to offer her as a sacrifice? True, I am prepared to make sacrifices in order to bring chaos to the world, but...
Rintaro|...No, there’s no problem. I shouldn’t have hesitated. Pathetic. Maybe I’m not cut out to be a mad scientist.
Rintaro|...Yeah, you might say her offer was a message. No doubt this too is the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo.
Moeka|...Thank you.
Rintaro|For what?
Moeka|...
Rintaro|I don’t think you’re selfish. In fact, I’m grateful for your offer.
Moeka|...
Mayuri|I think it’s a good idea! Moeka-san is a lab mem too!
Itaru|So, what sorta mail does Kiryu-shi plan to send?
Rintaro|My request is that its contents be simple and easy to measure, so that we can confirm whether or not the past changes.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|A secret? What do you mean?
Kurisu|What’s going on?
Moeka|...
Rintaro|No, that’s not the problem.
Kurisu|Hmmm, I see.
Kurisu|I understand how you feel, but since this is an experiment, data collection should take priority.
Rintaro|Oh? We agree for once, assistant.
Kurisu|I-I’m not agreeing with you, exactly. If we don’t collect data, then we’ll never figure out how the PhoneWave works.
Mayuri|But girls have lots of secrets, you know?
Mayuri|You shouldn’t ask her to tell her secrets, Okarin. That’s perverted!
Itaru|Whoa! Is that where we’re going with this!?
Rintaro|Calm down, Daru!
Rintaro|We’re not asking you to send something private.
Kurisu|Even if you want to send something private, you shouldn’t for now. We still don’t know how this thing handles paradoxes, so we need to be extremely careful.
Moeka|...Nothing private?
Kurisu|Nothing you want to keep secret, at least. Even if you mean well, the mail’s content might have a serious effect on the timeline.
Kurisu|You should show your mail to a third party and have them check if the content is problematic or not.
Rintaro|Indeed. My assistant said everything I wanted to say. I will add only that the experiment must go on!
Kurisu|...I wasn’t speaking for you. Don’t misunderstand.
Kurisu|Experiments prioritize data over privacy in the first place. If you’re going to be a test subject, you need to be prepared for that.
Mayuri|Really? Mayushii wasn’t prepared for that...
Mayuri|I’m sorry, Chris-chan...
Kurisu|You don’t have to apologize. I’m not criticizing you. It’s just how these things work.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|You’re a lab mem. You need to trust us. Save private information for another day.
Rintaro|If you can’t... then I’ll be forced to show you what lies dormant inside of the great Hououin Kyouma -- the terrible power of insanity!
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Well, I can show you my arrival history.
Moeka|...And the send history?
Rintaro|Don’t have one. The send history disappears after you send the email.
Moeka|...
Mayuri|You don’t have to if you don’t want to, Moeka-san.
Itaru|So, whatcha gonna send? Okarin wants us to change the past in an easy-to-measure way, but that’s setting the bar way too high.
Rintaro|Nonsense. You’re all just aiming too low.
Moeka|I... have an idea.
Rintaro|Oh? This could be good. Give us the details.
Rintaro|Excellent, Shining Finger! You’re a model lab mem!
Itaru|Oh, that’s the GG01 that just came out last month.
Mayuri|Gee Gee Zero One?
Itaru|The latest model. Pretty sure the screen is detachable, so you can swap out attachments for it.
Itaru|It’s in short supply right now, so you need to be placed on a waitlist. Nice job getting one.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|So, Finger.
Mayuri|Um, why do you call Moeka-san ’Finger’?
Rintaro|That’s the name of her esper power. Kiryu Moeka, I dub thee Shining Finger! Use this name with pride.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|What? You don’t like it? But it’s such a cool name. What’s the problem!?
Mayuri|Moeka-san is Moeka-san. Her fingers don’t shine or anything...
Itaru|Don’t feed the trolls, Mayu-shi.
Rintaro|I’m not trolling, just naming her power.
Kurisu|Cut the chatter and get started.
Itaru|What if the manager says something?
Rintaro|Muhahaha! Don’t be afraid of Mister Braun! If he storms in yelling, I’ll kick him to the curb!
Itaru|Seriously? Okarin, you’re so cool! That’s why we love you!
Kurisu|He’s just talk.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|PhoneWave (name subject to change), activate!
Rintaro|Guh!!
Rintaro|Where’s Shining Finger? Where’d she go?
Kurisu|Shining what?
Itaru|Okarin. Japanese please.
Rintaro|Where’s Kiryu Moeka? She was here just now, wasn’t she!?
Mayuri|Uhwhaaa?
Mayuri|Whoooo?
Rintaro|Kiryu Moeka!
Itaru|Who’s that?
Kurisu|Never heard of her.
Rintaro|...No way.
Kurisu|Did it happen again, Okabe?
Rintaro|What do you mean, ’again’?
Kurisu|Something like this happened yesterday. You remembered something we didn’t. Uh, what did you call it?
Kurisu|Oh yeah, Reading Steiner.
Mayuri|Are you okay? You’re really pale.
Rintaro|Y-yeah... I’m fine.
Rintaro|...Assistant, how much do you remember about the experiment we just did?
Kurisu|I don’t remember doing any experiments today.
Kurisu|You sent a D-Mail just now, didn’t you?
Rintaro|...Yeah.
Rintaro|But things are different from yesterday. I didn’t send the D-Mail. Kiryu Moeka did.
Rintaro|Christina. Let’s say a D-Mail caused a time paradox. What would happen?
Kurisu|...I don’t know. No one has experienced a time paradox, after all.
Rintaro|But before, didn’t you say something like the world would disappear?
Kurisu|All I said was that that was one theory.
Kurisu|Maybe nothing happens, and like in a certain movie, history gets amended to accommodate the paradox.
Kurisu|According to Dr.Hawking’s chronology protection conjecture, it’s impossible to do anything that might cause a time paradox in the first place.
Mayuri|Um, Mayushii doesn’t really understand...
Mayuri|But we’re all fine now, right? I don’t think that paradox thing happened.
Mayuri|Mayushii doesn’t know who Moeka-san is, but I’m sure she’s okay too♪
Itaru|That’s Mayu-shi for you. A cute dumb girl.
Mayuri|Ehh? Mayushii’s not dumb!
Rintaro|...!
Rintaro|...Ha, haha.
Kurisu|Explain what happened, Okabe.
Kurisu|Hmmm.
Kurisu|...Honestly, I’m not surprised she disappeared from the lab.
Rintaro|What do you mean?
Kurisu|I don’t know the details, but when the past changed, Kiryu-san’s actions these past four days changed ever so slightly.
Kurisu|As a result, the timeline was reconfigured so that Moeka-san didn’t come to the lab today.
Itaru|Is that even possible?
Kurisu|I don’t know. If the fact that the D-Mail was sent is undone, then it becomes a paradox of who sent that D-Mail...
Kurisu|And there’s one other thing that I don’t understand.
Rintaro|What?
Kurisu|What you call Reading Steiner.
Kurisu|By the way, you should quit it with that name. It’s stupid.
Rintaro|Hmph, I didn’t ask for your opinion.
Kurisu|By your explanation, you neither sent nor received the D-Mail. Yet how come you’re the only one who remembers what happened before the worldline changed?
Kurisu|What if it’s all in your head?
Itaru|Like an imaginary girlfriend. I get it.
Rintaro|No you don’t. I’m not a ’gentleman perv’ like you, creating imaginary relationships.
Kurisu|Maybe this Kiryu-san never existed. Or maybe Kiryu-san does exist, but the fact that she sent a D-Mail was something you made--
Rintaro|Gwaaaah!
Kurisu|...eh?
Rintaro|Ugh, ggh... my left eye, Reading Steiner, it aches!
Mayuri|Okarin, are you okay?
Rintaro|No, Mayuri! S-stay away! I don’t... want to hurt you!
Mayuri|But Okarin, you look like you’re in pain...
Itaru|...He’s messing with us, right?
Kurisu|Y-yeah...
Rintaro|I-I’m okay... This aching is normal... it’ll end soon!
Rintaro|As long as I have this magic eye... the Organization will keep coming after me! It’s the power to see across time and space... but at the same time, it’s a double-edged sword!
Rintaro|Because of this all-seeing eye... I have lost my connection to causality. I drift alone in the space between worlds.
Rintaro|But even so... I swore to protect this lab! So quiet thy fury, Reading Steiner! Your time will come... but not yet.
Mayuri|Okarin? Does it hurt?
Rintaro|No... I’m okay now.
Kurisu|W-what? That was just an act, right?
Rintaro|You are wrong, Christina.
Rintaro|Our experiments have already proven...
Rintaro|That I...
Rintaro|That my Reading Steiner is genuine!
Kurisu|Fine, I get it. You’re a chuunibyou patient.
Itaru|Eh?
Mayuri|Hm?
Kurisu|Ah...
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|Wh-why are you all staring at me? Don’t look at me!
Rintaro|Going home?
Mayuri|Yup.
Kurisu|Do you always stay the night here?
Rintaro|Pretty much. I wouldn’t be a true mad scientist if I couldn’t stay overnight at my lab, immersed in research.
Kurisu|I think you’re putting too much emphasis on appearances.
Mayuri|But you know, this place is really convenient. Mayushii would stay over if mom and dad let me.
Kurisu|Y-you would?
Mayuri|And it’s so close to work too♪ Hey, Chris-chan, why don’t we all stay over some time?
Kurisu|Sure, if the guys aren’t around.
Rintaro|That won’t happen.
Kurisu|Then why don’t you come to my hotel, Mayuri-san?
Mayuri|Oh yeah, we did make that promise, huh? Ehehe! Then let’s do that next time♪
Kurisu|You can come whenever you like. See you tomorrow.
Mayuri|...Hey, Okarin.
Rintaro|Yeah. A shooting star. Did you make a wish?
Mayuri|Remember how back in elementary school, you got a terrible fever and stayed in bed for a month?
Rintaro|Why are you bringing this up?
Mayuri|I was so afraid that Okarin might die.
Mayuri|So Granny and I prayed to the sky together. ’Don’t die, Okarin.’
Rintaro|Heh, something like that could never kill me! Ten years ago, I was already a mad scientist with an IQ of 170, equaling that of Thomas Edison!
Mayuri|Really? That’s amazing!
Mayuri|But Mayushii was still really small, and didn’t know that, so I prayed to the sky.
Mayuri|And then, on New Year’s Eve, right before midnight, a shooting star went pewww across the sky. Just like now.
Mayuri|If you repeat your wish three times before a shooting star disappears, your wish will come true. Did you know that?
Mayuri|It was hard, but Mayushii repeated her wish three times.
Mayuri|The next day, on New Years, your fever went down, and you woke up.
Mayuri|So basically, Mayushii saved your life! Ehehe!
Rintaro|No. It was simply the choice of Steins Gate.
Mayuri|Ehh? Really?
Rintaro|Really.
Mayuri|Oh...
Mayuri|Hey. Remember what you said when your fever went down?
Mayuri|You said everything went blurry and twisty like, and the ground shook so bad you couldn’t stand. Remember?’
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|You were acting kind of like that just now.
Mayuri|Are you okay? You’re not coming down with a fever, are you?
Rintaro|I’m fine. Don’t worry about a thing.
Rintaro|I see! So this power was already mine back then! Muhahaha!
Luka|Pardon the intrusion...
Itaru|Oh, if it isn’t Luka-shi.
Luka|Hello, Hashida-san, Okabe-san.
Rintaro|Lukako! You don’t have Demon Sword Samidare with you! What is the meaning of this!?
Luka|Eh, eh, eh?
Rintaro|I even unsealed the treasured heirloom sword Mistilteinn when I heard you were coming today. I’m disappointed in you. 
Luka|I’m sorry! Um, I’ll go back and get it.
Rintaro|No, that’s okay. It was not Mistilteinn’s fate to encounter Samidare this day.
Itaru|But a Japanese sword and a cursed sword from Norse mythology are so mismatched it’s not even funny. Do we even have a sword here?
Luka|What should I...
Rintaro|Lukako, though you are my disciple, you still lack dedication.
Luka|I-I’m sorry!
Rintaro|At this rate, it will take some time before you can be useful.
Rintaro|By the way, why not join our lab?
Luka|Eh, me?
Luka|But I’m clumsy, and I’m not good at science or engineering... I’ll probably just get in your way...
Luka|Do you really want me?
Rintaro|Don’t sweat it. Mayuri’s the same.
Mayuri|We’d love to have you, Luka-kun!
Mayuri|But you know, if Luka-kun’s gonna be a lab mem, then Mayushii has one condition for Okarin. Don’t tease Luka-kun.
Mayuri|And today, Luka-kun is Mayushii’s guest. He came for a fitting session, so don’t get in our way.
Luka|But Mayuri-chan, I don’t really want to cosplay... Um, can it really just be a fitting session?
Mayuri|Yup. We’re just making sure the size matches!
Mayuri|Tadah♪
Mayuri|This is a costume of Kirari-chan from RaiNet!
Mayuri|Anyway, I’d say it’s about 70% complete, but I want Luka-kun to try it on now♪
Luka|Try it on? Here?
Luka|I can’t...
Mayuri|Please?
Rintaro|Listen, my pupil. To change your clothes is to change your very being. This costume might help you grow stronger. Put it on at once!
Luka|You’re on her side? I just... can’t wear something so embarrassing!
Rintaro|It’s only embarrassing because you think it is.
Mayuri|That’s right! I’m sure you’ll be really cute♪
Rintaro|Besides, Mayuri worked very hard to make this costume so you could wear it.
Rintaro|She sacrificed her sleeping time, her favorite banana nourishment time, and her Juicy Chicken Number One time just so she could sew and sew and sew.
Rintaro|You can’t let effort like that go to waste.
Luka|That’s true, but...
Mayuri|Come on, Luka-kun! Transform! Tra-ns-form♪
Luka|Eh, wait a sec, wahhhhhhh!
Mayuri|Okay! Don’t be shy! Now take off your clothes.
Luka|Wahh! Mayuri-chan, please don’t touch me there! I’ll change by myself! Please wait outside!
Mayuri|But it’s a little tricky putting this on. Mayushii will teach you all the steps♪
Luka|Hyeeehhh, please don’t undress me!
Itaru|It’s so... yuri.
Rintaro|That’s not yuri. Lukako’s a guy.
Itaru|Then it’s reverse rape!? Whoa, that’s downright criminal!
Mayuri|Come on, Luka-kun! Don’t be shy.
Mayuri|Luka-kun?
Luka|...
Luka|...
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Waaahh! Luka-kun finally wore one of my outfits!
Luka|I-it’s so embarrassing... I’m a guy... I shouldn’t be dressing like this...
Mayuri|You know what they say. Cuteness is Justice♪
Luka|I don’t know what you mean!
Itaru|Excellent work as usual. The clothes and the model bring out the best in each other.
Itaru|As far as 3D goes, Faris-tan is supreme, but Luka-shi almost makes me wanna become a low angler.
Mayuri|What about you, Okarin?
Rintaro|Ah, yeah, well...
Rintaro|It’s me! My sanity is under attack! No, it’s not the Organization. It’s a descendent... of one of the town’s... guardian miko! Guh! It’s... infecting my soul!
Rintaro|To think... Akiba had... such a powerful guardian! If we can harness this power... we can counteract the Organization’s corrupting influence.
Rintaro|...I know. We can’t hand the town over to those bastards just yet. This, too, is the choice of Steins Gate... El Psy Kongroo!
Rintaro|Whew... Lukako. Foolish disciple of mine. From now on, you shall go into battle equipped with that costume and Samidare.
Luka|Eh...
Mayuri|Ehh? Kirari-chan doesn’t have a sword! He should carry an Upa instead♪
Rintaro|The Organization is making a move on Akiba.
Rintaro|You are the guardian who protects this chaotic metropolis. Miko of Yanabayashi Shrine, now is the time for you to fulfill that duty!
Rintaro|Understand, Lukako? This is the reason I’m so hard on you. You have a duty to protect this town!
Luka|Do I... really?
Rintaro|You certainly do! Muhahaha!
Kurisu|Can you stop that vulgar laughter? I can hear you from outside. It’s embarrassing.
Mayuri|Chris-chan, tutturu♪
Rintaro|Mmgh!? You come here this late and dare insult me? And you call yourself my assistant!?
Kurisu|I’m not your assistant. Don’t make me repeat myself.
Kurisu|Anyway! You’re the worst, toying with such a weak and innocent girl. Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?
Itaru|Toying with a weak and innocent girl, you say?
Kurisu|Don’t react to every little thing, you perv.
Kurisu|At any rate...
Rintaro|Christina. Stop eying Lukako’s entire body from top to bottom like that.
Kurisu|I-I wasn’t doing that!
Mayuri|Do you like the costume, Chris-chan? It really suits Luka-kun, dontcha think?
Kurisu|Is this that cosplay thing I’ve heard about? It’s part of Japanimation culture, right?
Kurisu|You’re very cute.
Luka|C-c-cute? No way...
Kurisu|Why are you crying? You look perfect, so you should be more confident.
Luka|Uuugh...
Rintaro|Heh heh heh...
Rintaro|Lukako! Tell us your wish.
Luka|Eh...?
Kurisu|That’s one hell of an acrobatic topic change.
Rintaro|Listen, Lukako! Your desires can become reality. Japan is a land of great spiritual power. It resides in every word that slips from your tongue!
Rintaro|Now that you too have joined the otaku world, you need conceal your deepest desires no longer!
Rintaro|Speak your wish with a true heart, and by the chaos that rules Akihabara, Steins Gate shall grant it!
Luka|My... wish?
Luka|Well...
Luka|If I tell you... promise not to laugh?
Rintaro|There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Just proclaim it to the world!
Kurisu|Well yeah, no wish is embarrassing compared to the idiotic wish for chaos to envelop the world or whatever.
Rintaro|You, assistant! What kind of person laughs at people’s wishes!?
Mayuri|Um, Mayushii’s wish is to eat a ton of of yummy food, and to cover the lab with Upa goods, and to get Luka-kun to wear my costumes--
Rintaro|I’m not asking you.
Mayuri|But Mayushii wants ’Shota in the Gate’ to grant her wish too!
Itaru|’Shota in the Gate’!? That mistake is god tier. Probably because it’s so... naughty.
Luka|I want... to be a girl.
Kurisu|...What?
Luka|I don’t really... like how I look...
Luka|I always thought... that if I were a girl... I could be a little more confident...
Kurisu|Wait. Wait a second.
Kurisu|Umm, what did she say?
Rintaro|Heh, heh, heh. Assistant mine -- no, Christina!
Kurisu|I’m not your assistant, and I’m not Christina!
Rintaro|You’ve made a grave error!
Kurisu|I have?
Rintaro|Don’t you understand? No, of course you don’t. How could you, with impure thoughts clouding your eyes!
Kurisu|Wh-what do you mean?
Rintaro|Allow me to explain. You called Lukako here a ’weak and innocent girl.’
Rintaro|But he’s not a girl at all. He’s a guy!
Kurisu|Is that some kind of joke?
Rintaro|It’s not a joke, but the naked truth as described in the Akashic Records! Muhahaha!
Kurisu|...Are you guys trolling me?
Rintaro|Eh?
Itaru|Eh?
Kurisu|...Eh?
Kurisu|Is what Okabe says true?
Luka|Y-yes...
Luka|I’m... a guy...
Kurisu|N-no way! Someone this cute can’t be a boy!
Itaru|You’ve got it backwards. You’re supposed to say ’Someone this cute can’t be a girl.’
Kurisu|That’s not what I meant.
Rintaro|Lukako. You’re fine just the way you are. I will not reject you, be you man or be you woman. Nor will anyone else here.
Rintaro|And I will not deny your wish. Nor will anyone else here.
Itaru|Why do you keep repeating that last part?
Rintaro|Why, Christina. Is it such a shock to meet a man far more feminine than you?
Kurisu|I admit it. Compared to her... I mean, to him, I’m not as cute, I talk more rudely, and my attitude is worse...
Kurisu|This is a three-day-coma level shock.
Mayuri|Chris-chan’s cute too♪
Kurisu|Don’t try to comfort me. It just makes me feel worse.
Rintaro|Admitting your faults is the first step towards becoming stronger. You may one day become a splendid woman, Christina. You’re still young.
Kurisu|Who the hell asked you?
Rintaro|I take it back! You’re a stubborn fool who refuses to face the truth!
Kurisu|Shut up. I don’t want to hear that from you.
Luka|Um... sorry. I shouldn’t have said anything.
Itaru|Welp, better get my trusty digicam...
Kurisu|Don’t try to sneak in a photo session, you perv!
Itaru|Anzai-sensei, I want to be a low angler...
Rintaro|Lukako, how serious are you about that wish of yours?
Luka|You know those stories where a guy magically turns into a girl overnight? Sometimes I wish that would happen to me.
Luka|Ahaha... that’s stupid, isn’t it?
Mayuri|Luka-kun, you’re so cute♪
Kurisu|S-So cute...
Kurisu|This reminds me of something I heard once.
Itaru|Exposition scene, go!
Kurisu|There’s a saying that if you eat a lot of meat when you’re pregnant, you’ll have a boy, and if you eat a lot of vegetables, you’ll have a girl.
Itaru|Source? Minmei Shobou?
Kurisu|I saw it on the internet.
Itaru|S-so that’s how you reply... well played.
Kurisu|Wh-what are you talking about?
Mayuri|Really? I didn’t know that. So Mayushii and Chris-chan’s moms ate a lot of vegetables?
Mayuri|Mayushii only eats Juicy Chicken Number One, so will her future child be a boy?
Mayuri|Hey, do you think bananas count as vegetables?
Rintaro|But what about primitive people who lived on hunting? If that theory is true, then they would have had too many boys and not enough girls.
Rintaro|Humanity would never have made it this far.
Kurisu|I never said it was true.
Kurisu|I just remembered hearing it somewhere. Don’t snap at every little thing.
Rintaro|I didn’t snap. Christina, feel like verifying that theory?
Kurisu|...What are you implying?
Rintaro|Have you forgotten? We have the PhoneWave (name subject to change)!
Mayuri|PhoneWave-chan? It can tell if you’ll have a boy or a girl?
Kurisu|Wait... of course.
Kurisu|We can send a D-Mail to Urushibara-san’s mother when she was pregnant.
Rintaro|Indeed. Something like ’Eat more vegetables!’
Rintaro|You think it’s worth a shot?
Kurisu|Well...
Rintaro|It’s too late to hide behind your goody-two-shoes mask, Christina. Your fate is to become a mad scientist, for you are an experiment-loving girl!
Kurisu|Who are you calling an experiment-loving girl!?
Rintaro|Am I wrong?
Kurisu|N-no, but...
Itaru|Hold on, man! What are you going to do if the experiment works?
Rintaro|What do you mean?
Itaru|I mean, if Luka-shi’s sex seriously changes.
Rintaro|That’s what he wants, isn’t it?
Itaru|Well, yeah, but...
Itaru|If his sex does change, won’t the 16 years of his life change too? That’s what I mean.
Itaru|Who’s gonna take responsibility for that?
Rintaro|That’s...
Luka|Um... I’ll take responsibility...
Itaru|Seriously?
Luka|Well, I don’t really understand... but if we use this method, I might become a girl, right?
Luka|Then... I want to try.
Luka|Please, Master.
Rintaro|Mayuri, your opinion?
Mayuri|Hmm... If Luka-kun becomes a girl, then I’ve gotta call her Luka-chan!
Mayuri|Will Luka-chan wear Mayushii’s costumes?
Luka|Um, well, that’s another story...
Rintaro|Then that settles it. Lukako, I appoint you Lab Mem 006.
Luka|Eh...?
Rintaro|The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is our lab’s most important secret. In order to use it, you must become a lab mem.
Luka|Ah! Okay!
Luka|Actually... I always wanted to be a lab member.
Mayuri|Really? You should’ve just said so!
Luka|I didn’t have the courage... Like I said, I don’t know a thing about gadgets...
Mayuri|You don’t have to worry about those things. I mean, Mayuri doesn’t get them either.
Rintaro|So Lukako shall be a lab mem from this point forth. Any objections?
Kurisu|Here.
Kurisu|I want to give Urushibara-san my number so I can retire.
Rintaro|Denied. Anyone else?
Kurisu|...*sigh*
Rintaro|Very well. Lukako is officially Lab Mem Number 006. Henceforth, pledge your allegiance to the lab, and devote all your strength to the enrichment of our science.
Luka|Y-yes! I will! I’m so happy.
Rintaro|Now then, let’s begin the experiment immedia--
Rintaro|Damn! Lukako, you’re 16, right?
Luka|Um... right.
Rintaro|So you were born in 1993...
Mayuri|Yup! The same year as Mayushii. What about it?
Rintaro|When did cellphones become widespread in Japan!?
Kurisu|Ah...
Itaru|Around 1996. There wasn’t mail until later, though.
Rintaro|So the year Lukako was born, most people still didn’t have cellphones.
Rintaro|Lukako’s mother may not have had one. In that case, she might not be able to receive the D-Mail!
Mayuri|Oh! I get it!
Luka|Eh...? We can’t do it?
Itaru|What about modifying it to send crazy waves or something?
Kurisu|What the hell are crazy waves?
Itaru|Waves that only crazy girls can pick up. You know, girls who always talk about stuff no one understands. It’s pretty moe.
Kurisu|I’ll microwave your brain if you don’t shut up.
Itaru|Yes! Abuse me more, please!
Mayuri|Um, couldn’t you put a letter in a time capsule and bury it?
Kurisu|That would go to the future, not the past.
Mayuri|Oh...
Itaru|I know! How about that thing where you get struck by lightning and that turns you into a girl! Like in old comics and anime.
Kurisu|There’s no point to the experiment if we don’t use D-Mail. Don’t lose sight of the objective.
Mayuri|We’re counting on you for a nice idea, Chris-chan♪
Kurisu|M-me? I...
Kurisu|We could... build a rocket which exceeds the speed of light squared, then that immense speed would reverse the flow of time, or something...
Itaru|You’re forgetting about the PhoneWave too.
Rintaro|Furthermore, genius girl, you just contradicted relativity.
Kurisu|It was just a joke. Don’t take it seriously.
Rintaro|Useless, all of you! This lab is a disgrace!
Kurisu|Fine then. Let’s hear from Hououin Kyouma, the insane mad scientist with an IQ over 170 whose brain cells are coveted the world over. What’s your genius plan?
Rintaro|Hmm... Inspiration flashes in the corners of my brain.
Itaru|That Edison thing again?
Rintaro|I have it.
Rintaro|If we can’t send it to a cellphone, then we’ll send it... to a pager!
Luka|H-hello...
Luka|Mom had a pager.
Mayuri|Yay! That’s great, Luka-kun!
Kurisu|Now we can proceed with the experiment.
Itaru|Luka-shi’s girl version... will definitely be moe.
Kurisu|Urushibara-san, you need to think about what to send to your mother in the past.
Luka|Eh...? I do?
Rintaro|If you want to grant your wish, then you must open the door with your own hands. We can only show you the way.
Luka|I understand...
Luka|Umm...
Itaru|This is a pain. Let’s just send ’831831831’. That should do it.
Mayuri|Why 831?
Itaru|8(ya) 3(sa) 1(i) for veggies (yasai), duh. VEGGIES VEGGIES VEGGIES -- we just have to drill this into Luka-shi’s mother’s brain.
Rintaro|She’ll just pass that message off as a prank.
Mayuri|Then, how about ’29292929’?
Rintaro|I’m going to regret asking this, but what does that mean?
Mayuri|Ni(2) ku(9) for meat. MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT.
Rintaro|Why do you want her to like meat!?
Mayuri|That’s not it! If you keep repeating ’MEAT’, then she’ll actually start to hate meat and want to eat vegetables instead, don’t you think?
Itaru|Yeah... no.
Luka|How about something like this?
Luka|’MOM EAT VEGGIES OK’
Itaru|Isn’t that a little too vague?
Rintaro|And the first ’MOM’ should go. That’ll just make it harder to believe.
Luka|Then... ’EAT LOTS OF VEGGIES TO GIVE BIRTH TO A GIRL’.
Kurisu|That’s a little too direct. And it’s over the character limit.
Luka|’EAT VEGGIES FOR HEALTHY KID’
Itaru|Wait a sec. According to this conversion chart, it looks like you gotta use two more numbers for voiced consonants.
Itaru|So that sentence is four bytes over.
Rintaro|Then a little modification. How about ’EAT VEG 4 HEALTHY KID’?
Kurisu|Isn’t that a little too informal? You’re talking to Urushibara-san’s mother, you know? Would she understand the ’VEG 4’ part?
Rintaro|You have any bright ideas?
Mayuri|Come on, let’s type it out!
Rintaro|Alright, we’re good to go.
Luka|...
Rintaro|Ready? I’m starting it up.
Rintaro|Nn...
Luka|Um, Okabe-san, could you... please not look at me like that?
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|It... didn’t work?
Mayuri|What didn’t work?
Rintaro|Don’t you remember? Just now, we used the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to--
Rintaro|Sorry. It’s nothing.
Rintaro|Christina. I want to ask you something. Is Lukako...
Kurisu|What pervy act are you thinking about this time? Can’t be too careful around the perv duo.
Itaru|We’re not a perv duo. We are a pervy gentlemen duo!
Kurisu|Whatever. Seriously, whatever.
Rintaro|Muh...
Rintaro|Daru. What do you think about D-Mail?
Itaru|It’s cool, but it’s kinda lame at the same time.
Rintaro|What’s lame about it?
Itaru|I couldn’t use it to win my RaiNet match against Faris-tan.
Rintaro|As our experiments have shown, D-Mail still hasn’t reached a reliable level of precision.
Rintaro|A true time machine must remove luck from the equation. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is useless unless we can somehow give the sender more control.
Itaru|Yeah, we aren’t getting results. What about the LOTO SIX?
Rintaro|Pending.
Rintaro|Hououin Kyouma will not let this keep him down. I won’t give up. For I am a mad scientist!
Itaru|I don’t understand what you’re saying, but you sure seem confident about it.
Rintaro|Someday we will improve the PhoneWave (name subject to change) so that it may be used to send things not only to the past, but also to the future. We’ll improve it. No, we must improve it!
Rintaro|For that is the choice of Steins Gate! Muhahahaha!
Faris|A time machine!?
Rintaro|!!?
Rintaro|Damn you, Faris! Eavesdropping is cowardly!
Faris|What do you mean? Your voice is so loud, it echoes through the whole store nya.
Faris|Here’s your iced coffee, and your iced tea and ’cat food’. Thanks for waiting, nyan♪
Faris|Do you want milk and syrup nyan?
Rintaro|NEVER.
Faris|If Kyouma’s gonna be like that, I’ll pour it all in nya! You need sugar for a healthy brain, nyan♪
Faris|Nyan nyan, nyan nyan♪
Itaru|There it is! Faris-tan’s secret technique, ’Eye Contact Mix-Mix’!
Itaru|Most maids can’t do it without spilling a little, yet Faris-tan makes it look easy! That’s why I love her!
Itaru|It’s because of this secret technique that Faris-tan reigns supreme as MayQueen’s number one maid!
Itaru|Thank you, Faris-tan! I’ll be sure to savor it.
Rintaro|Do you need something?
Faris|I wanna hear the rest, nya♪
Faris|Kyouma and Daru-nyan were having a fun little chit-cat, nya? Something about a time machine.
Faris|Faris really wants to hear, nyan!
Rintaro|It’s top secret. Not for outsiders!
Faris|And whose big mouth let the whole store hear, nya?
Rintaro|...
Faris|Tell Faris, Daru-nyan...
Itaru|We’ve built an amazing machine that can send emails to the past. I did most of the work, of course.
Faris|Is that a time machine, nya!?
Itaru|I guess you could say that!
Faris|Wow! You’re awesome, nya! Your big brain makes my heart race, nyan.
Itaru|You mean it? N-now I’m embarrassed, hehehe.
Faris|Faris dreams of going on a journey through time nya.
Itaru|I’ll bring you along some day.
Rintaro|Daru, don’t make promises you can’t keep.
Faris|By the way, it’s been bugging me, but what is time anyway, nya?
Rintaro|What?
Faris|Time is often compared to a river, nya, flowing from past to future.
Faris|But is that really how it is, nya?
Faris|If time is a river, then where is the present, nya? Is it a point? Is it a line? Where does the present begin and end, nya?
Itaru|Now that you mention it, I only have a vague concept of time. Never gave it any serious thought.
Rintaro|The present is a leaf floating on the river. It moves along with the flow from past to future.
Faris|So are we riding on that leaf, nya? When you die, do you fall off, nyan?
Rintaro|You could say that. All points upstream from the leaf are the past. Downstream, the future.
Faris|Hmnya...
Faris|But is that leaf only the present for humans, nya?
Rintaro|Meaning...?
Faris|Humans make units to define and observe time, which is how we know this leaf is the present.
Faris|But if every living thing in the universe went extinct, nothing would exist to observe the present, nya.
Faris|In that case, where would the present go, nya?
Itaru|Wouldn’t something like God or the will of the universe observe it?
Faris|But what if God is a four-dimensional being who can freely move through time, nya?
Rintaro|U-uh...?
Faris|If God is the one who decides the present, then won’t our present move with him, nya?
Itaru|This is hard...
Rintaro|So what you’re saying is that the present is subjective to the observer.
Faris|If we go with that assumption, then the past and the future also depend on the observer, nyan.
Faris|If Faris were to use a time machine to travel back one week, then Kyouma and Daru-nyan’s present would become Faris’s future, nya.
Itaru|I guess that makes sense...
Faris|So how does the leaf model reflect that difference, nya?
Faris|Anyway, if everything depends on the observer, then clocks are meaningless, nyan.
Faris|Fun times fly, and hard times drag, nya. In other words, the flow of time changes depending on your point of view, nyan.
Itaru|Speaking of which, as you grow older, it feels like time starts to flow faster, doesn’t it?
Rintaro|Janet’s law...
Faris|Faris thinks about this stuff sometimes, nya. I think time might not be something as simple as a river, nyan.
Itaru|Yeah, the more you think about it, the more complicated it gets.
Rintaro|Heh. Heh heh heh. Muhahaha!
Faris|Nyanya?
Rintaro|Fret not. Though physics and philosophy may deny us, our machine has made time travel possible! Am I correct, Daru!?
Itaru|Yeah. Yeah! That’s right!
Faris|Nyaa... looks like you guys have kicked reason to the curb, nya.
Faris|But Faris wants to use the time machine too, nya. Can I, please?
Itaru|Sure! I’ll let you use it as much as you want, Faris-tan.
Faris|Really nya? Then it’s a promise, nya!
Rintaro|Daru, don’t decide things on your own!
Kurisu|What? You called me all the way to Japan, and now you--
Kurisu|...I knew it. You never wanted to see me, did you?
Kurisu|...sniff.
Kurisu|Why did you ask me to come here, then? Can you at least tell me tha--
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|I... I...
Rintaro|Y-yeah?
Kurisu|I wasn’t crying or anything, okay!?
Rintaro|No, you were definitely crying.
Kurisu|Don’t be ridiculous! Where’s your proof!?
Rintaro|Your eyes are red.
Kurisu|Ugh...
Kurisu|I wasn’t crying, okay!?
Rintaro|You’re not being very logical, Christina.
Kurisu|Anyway, I wasn’t crying. Understand? End of discussion. Sniff.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|Christina.
Kurisu|Shut up. Don’t talk to me.
Rintaro|Listen. You don’t have to talk. Just listen.
Rintaro|If there’s something troubling you, I’ll do everything in my power to help.
Kurisu|...Eh?
Rintaro|And it’s not just me. I’m sure I speak for Mayuri and Daru as well.
Rintaro|So don’t hesitate to come to us.
Rintaro|When you want to cry, don’t hold it in. Just let it out. We won’t reject you.
Rintaro|We’ll hear you out.
Kurisu|Why...
Rintaro|Because you’re important to us. You’re our friend.
Kurisu|Ah... yeah...
Kurisu|...I’m sorry. I was a little upset.
Rintaro|You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. Just tell me when you’re ready. I’ll hear you out.
Kurisu|...Okay.
Rintaro|Heh. Mayuri, you’re like a housewife burning the midnight oil to bring a little more money home.
Mayuri|Eh? Midnight oil? Are we eating?
Mayuri|Besides, Mayushii doesn’t charge for her costumes.
Mayuri|Hobbies should just be hobbies, you know. It makes me happy to see someone wearing a costume I made♪
Rintaro|Do you want to become a designer?
Mayuri|No way. It’s too hard!
Rintaro|Then what is your dream? Mine is to destroy the System and plunge the world into chaos.
Mayuri|Um... Mayushii just wants to keep hanging out in the lab.
Rintaro|What? You want to be a lab mem forever? I appreciate your enthusiasm, but this lab has no interest in profit. You’ll always be hurting for food.
Mayuri|You know, Okarin, we have six lab mems now. Isnt it amazing? Mayushii never expected we’d grow this big.
Mayuri|It’s all because Mayushii became your hostage!
Rintaro|No. That has nothing to do with it. I tricked every last one of you into joining with my masterful manipulations! Muhahaha!
Mayuri|You shouldn’t say things like that. And besides, you didn’t trick me!
Rintaro|That’s true. You came of your own volition.
Mayuri|Okarin?
Mayuri|Can Mayushii still be your hostage?
Rintaro|Is that what you want?
Mayuri|Well...
Mayuri|Maybe it is!
Rintaro|Such a masochist! I had no idea!
Mayuri|???
Mayuri|But I mean, as long as I’m your hostage, Mayushii won’t be lonely, and neither will Okarin. Ehehe!
Rintaro|I... I see.
Mayuri|Ah! I’d better get going.
Rintaro|Mayuri.
Mayuri|Hm?
Rintaro|Want to get something to eat on the way back? My treat.
Mayuri|Really? You never treat me.
Rintaro|Heh heh heh, I’m in a good mood today!
Mayuri|Then how about Kitchen Jiro?
Mayuri|Their minced cutlet is, um, god tier.
Rintaro|Just leave it to me.
Mayuri|Yay! I love you, Okarin♪ Mayushii’s really happy!
Rintaro|Thanks for coming in on a Saturday. Your devotion to science makes me proud.
Kurisu|Yeah...
Kurisu|It’s the middle of summer, but instead of going on vacation, I’m stuck in this sauna with a bunch of pervs.
Kurisu|Where did I go wrong?
Rintaro|Wipe your tears, you experiment-loving girl without a single friend.
Kurisu|I’m not crying!
Kurisu|Besides, you’re the one who told us to be here.
Rintaro|Indeed. But the one who obeyed my orders and arrived on time... was you.
Mayuri|You know, Chris-chan is actually a very honest and hardworking girl. That’s what Mayushii thinks♪
Mayuri|That’s what makes her so adorable.
Kurisu|Eh, wha...!?
Kurisu|How can this girl say something like that while eating a nugget...
Itaru|A yuri flag. I get it.
Kurisu|Please unget it.
Mayuri|Here, Chris-chan. Have a nugget.
Kurisu|Th-thanks...
Kurisu|Don’t put that there. It’s filthy.
Rintaro|I just washed them!
Kurisu|Like I care. What kind of guy puts his underwear in a girl’s face? Have some decency.
Rintaro|If you’re that interested in my underwear, then just say so.
Kurisu|Wh-wha...!
Kurisu|I’m not interested at all!
Mayuri|Come on, guys. No more talking about underwear. Mayushii’s trying to eat here, okay?
Itaru|How can you say that when you’re still shoveling nuggets into your mouth...
Rintaro|Don’t interrupt me!
Rintaro|As I explained to Daru yesterday, I’ve noticed something about the results of our experiments!
Rintaro|D-Mails have too many uncertain variables. We can never be sure what will happen when we send one.
Kurisu|It’s not like we can do anything about that. After all, the result is up to whoever receives the mail.
Kurisu|Of course, if you can analyze the recipient’s psychology, then you might be able to manipulate them into doing what you want.
Kurisu|Though that might be a bit too much for Hououin Underwear here.
Itaru|You just wanted to say underwear, didn’t you?
Rintaro|Underwear aside, the fact is that D-Mail is still far from complete.
Rintaro|And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I called you here today. The purpose of today’s Round Table Conference is--
Itaru|Another Round Table?
Kurisu|If you want a Round Table Conference that much, at least go buy a round table.
Mayuri|Remember what Okarin said, Chris-chan? The round table is in our hearts.
Kurisu|Mayuri-san, you’re really innocent. But you shouldn’t take everything Okabe says seriously.
Mayuri|Really?
Rintaro|The round table doesn’t matter now. More importantly, the purpose of today’s meeting...
Rintaro|Is to explore methods of true physical time travel, not just D-Mail, with the objective of sending someone to the past like SERN has.
Kurisu|Don’t be ridiculous.
Kurisu|SERN has the best equipment in the world, and even after nine years, they still haven’t succeeded.
Kurisu|We can’t possibly hope to accomplish something like that.
Mayuri|You’ll become a GelOkarin! Ehehe!
Itaru|Kinda sounds like Gero Froggy. Why did those things get popular, anyway?
Kurisu|This isn’t a laughing matter...
Rintaro|Isn’t it too early to give up? Haven’t we already succeeded with D-Mail, a first in human history?
Itaru|But we’re not the first. Didn’t SERN do it before us?
Rintaro|Humanity’s first time-traveling email. For we who have achieved that miracle, nothing is impossible!
Kurisu|Such baseless confidence. Anyway, wasn’t it just a coincidence that we discovered D-Mail?
Kurisu|We still haven’t figured out what’s functioning as the lifter.
Rintaro|We just need to figure that out, don’t we?
Kurisu|It’s futile.
Kurisu|How do you solve a problem that even SERN can’t figure out?
Kurisu|If you can’t set the destination, then you don’t know where you’ll leap to.
Itaru|I’ll pass on leaping into deep space, thanks.
Rintaro|Wait a second.
Rintaro|We don’t set the destination when we send a D-Mail, yet it still arrives where it’s supposed to. How do you explain that?
Kurisu|Now that you mention it...
Itaru|You set the mail address, right? Isn’t that enough?
Kurisu|Is it? I don’t think a phone signal can be received from millions of kilometers away.
Mayuri|I bet you’d get a busy signal or something!
Rintaro|Maybe our cellphones are acting like black holes and white holes.
Kurisu|You shouldn’t speculate like that. You have zero basis.
Rintaro|Is it possible that we form a wormhole?
Kurisu|No wormholes have ever been confirmed to exist.
Rintaro|In any case, the cold, hard truth is that D-Mails arrive precisely when and where we want them to. We’re ahead of SERN in that regard.
Rintaro|Now, can we apply D-Mail technology to physical time travel?
Itaru|But with D-Mails, you can only send 36 bytes of data.
Itaru|No way you can send a whole person with that kind of limit.
Kurisu|If you want to become GelOkarin, I’m not stopping you.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|It would be best to leave physical transfer aside for now. Sending data through time is an amazing feat by itself. We should be satisfied with what we’ve got.
Rintaro|Such pessimism is unbecoming of a scientist sworn to uncover the secrets of the universe.
Kurisu|I’m telling you to know your limits.
Kurisu|If you’re going to uncover the secrets of the universe, you need personnel, equipment, and funding to rival SERN’s.
Kurisu|It’s one thing to set lofty goals, but this impoverished lab has no resources to speak of.
Kurisu|I’ve been thinking. Maybe we should bring the PhoneWave to a proper research institution and entrust it to a specialist.
Kurisu|SERN’s keeping their time machine research top secret, so if we make an official announcement, it’ll benefit the future of mankind.
Rintaro|...If we make an official announcement, the Organization will become aware of my existence.
Kurisu|Oh come on! I’m being serious here. This isn’t the time for your childish--
Rintaro|And we’ve hacked into SERN.
Rintaro|Those heartless bastards will do anything, even experiment on human beings. And behind them is a power greater than all the nations of the Earth.
Rintaro|If we make the PhoneWave (name subject to change) public, they might have us erased.
Kurisu|...You watch too many movies.
Rintaro|The name ’Committee of 300’ appeared in actual SERN documents.
Kurisu|Yeah, but...
Mayuri|Mayushii’s kinda scared...
Itaru|If they find out about our hacking, they’ll seriously have us killed. I didn’t make any mistakes that could give us away, of course.
Rintaro|Also, and this is the biggest problem--
Rintaro|If we go public, we won’t be able to do cool stuff with D-Mails anymore!
Kurisu|Why you...
Rintaro|Muhahaha! No way I’m giving up such an awesome machine!
Rintaro|I am Hououin Kyouma! The insane mad scientist who rules space and time! What I desire is -- that’s right -- CHAOS!
Kurisu|This guy’s hopeless. Better do something quick.
Itaru|Eh?
Rintaro|Hm?
Mayuri|Hwe?
Kurisu|Ah...
Rintaro|Christina. Are you an @channe--
Kurisu|Shut up! I’m not, okay!?
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Th-that reminds me, Daru. Have you made any progress hacking into SERN?
Itaru|Yeah, right now I’m combing SERN’s massive database.
Itaru|It would take years to read it all. For now, I’ve passed everything that looks important to Makise-shi for translation.
Itaru|Basically, I’ve gone as deep as I can go.
Itaru|SERN belongs to me now.
Rintaro|Thank goodness you’re on my side.
Rintaro|Christina. Report on the status of these translations.
Kurisu|Can you stop talking like that? It’s pretentious and annoying as hell.
Mayuri|Hell☆
Mayuri|Um, Chris-chan, as Okarin’s childhood friend, I promise you’ll get used to how he talks eventually.
Kurisu|I just hope it doesn’t take ten years...
Rintaro|So you’re saying you want to stay with me for ten years? In other words, you want to work at this lab for the rest of your--
Kurisu|It was sarcasm, get it? Sarcasm.
Rintaro|...Oh.
Rintaro|Give me your report, Christina. If you don’t, I’ll call you an ’@channeler’--
Kurisu|Didn’t you hear me the first time!?
Kurisu|I’ve been working on the translation when I have time, but so far I haven’t seen anything new about time travel.
Kurisu|It looks like SERN is still struggling to find a solution.
Rintaro|Daru, any other results?
Itaru|Well, it looks like SERN’s in the middle of a big project, so the LHC’s at full operation.
Itaru|I’m trying to see if I can cut in and maybe use it secretly.
Kurisu|What? No way.
Mayuri|Is that amazing?
Kurisu|It’s not amazing. It’s downright outrageous!
Kurisu|Super Hacka, what a monster!
Rintaro|Hey, Christina. Are you doing that on purpose?
Kurisu|Ugh... d-doing what?
Itaru|Anyway, I’m just doing it for laughs. It’s not like we have any reason to use the LHC.
Rintaro|It sounds like things are going smoothly. When do you begin stage three of the operation?
Itaru|What’s stage three?
Rintaro|SERN’s most secret, forbidden domain. We’re going to free the darkness hidden inside.
Itaru|In Japanese please.
Rintaro|The IBN 5100 database. I’m asking if you’ve started hacking it yet.
Itaru|We can’t, remember?
Rintaro|You said all we needed was an IBN 5100 of our own!
Itaru|Right. That’s the problem. We can’t do anything without one.
Rintaro|Huh?
Rintaro|But I got you an IBN 5100. You haven’t started working on it yet?
Itaru|Huh? You got one? When?
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|First I’ve heard of it.
Rintaro|Impossible!
Rintaro|...It’s gone.
Rintaro|The IBN 5100 was right here! Where did it go!?
Rintaro|Why are you staring at me like that!? The legendary PC that was donated to Yanabayashi Shrine!! You’ve seen it! Remember!?
Mayuri|I don’t remember.
Itaru|Donated to Yanabayashi Shrine? That’s stupid.
Kurisu|You sure you weren’t hallucinating? It’s hot these days.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Don’t tell me it was John Titor!?
Rintaro|Of course! Titor’s goal was to obtain an IBN 5100! And I’ve already contacted him several times. But how did he get my personal information!?
Kurisu|Calm down.
Kurisu|Tell us what happened. You don’t have to be precise. Just say whatever comes to mind. We can work it out later.
Rintaro|Y-yeah...
Kurisu|Hmmm...
Kurisu|The IBN 5100 may have disappeared as a result of changes someone made to the past.
Rintaro|Ohh! So you believe me!
Kurisu|But from my perspective, all of the D-Mails we sent so far were trivial.
Mayuri|Um, there’s that one we sent when we first realized PhoneWave-chan was a time machine, right?
Itaru|The one that said ’Okarin is a perv’.
Kurisu|And during the preliminary D-Mail experiments, I sent dozens to Okabe’s phone. But they were all insubstantial, so I don’t think they could’ve changed the past.
Itaru|I sent two of them when I was trying to win the match against Faris.
Kurisu|There was one more. The first mail Okabe accidentally sent that said I was dead.
Rintaro|But from my perspective, we sent several more.
Mayuri|You mean how you sent the winning LOTO SIX numbers? And how Luka-chan bought a ticket with those numbers, but didn’t win?
Kurisu|But nobody aside from Okabe remembers him sending it.
Rintaro|But I showed you guys afterwards. It was still in my phone’s arrival history.
Itaru|We were so close.
Mayuri|Is that all?
Rintaro|No. There’s more. Moeka and Lukako each sent a D-Mail.
Kurisu|Oh, right. That’s what you claim, but Hashida, Mayuri-san, and I don’t remember either of those.
Mayuri|Owww... Mayushii’s getting a headache...
Rintaro|I already told you guys. I’m the only one who keeps his memories after the world changes.
Kurisu|So according to your perspective, when did the IBN 5100 disappear? Did it just happen? When’s the last time you remember seeing it in the lab?
Rintaro|Well...
Rintaro|I’m sure... it was August 3rd. I remember it being in the lab on August 3rd.
Kurisu|Are you certain?
Rintaro|I... think so.
Luka|Hello, Okabe-san.
Luka|Um... p-please forget what you saw the other day...
Rintaro|I saw something?
Luka|My... cosplay...
Rintaro|More importantly, I have questions about the IBN 5100.
Luka|The... eyebeam... five?
Rintaro|IBN 5100. About nine years ago, someone dedicated a retro PC to Yanabayashi Shrine. That’s the one. Know anything?
Luka|...
Luka|Y-yes.
Rintaro|Just a while ago, I came to the shrine looking for it, didn’t I!? And then I asked your old man and he let me borrow it. Right!?
Luka|Eh...?
Luka|I don’t...
Rintaro|...Right?
Luka|I don’t remember anything like that...
Rintaro|The IBN 5100 was at the shrine though, right? Is it there now?
Luka|Um... I don’t know the details...
Rintaro|Where are you now? Is your old man there?
Luka|...No.
Rintaro|...Damn. Okay. Sorry for calling you so suddenly.
Luka|N-no problem. I’m sorry that I couldn’t help..
Rintaro|Mayuri, I need to contact Faris.
Mayuri|Hweh?
Mayuri|Want one, Okarin? They’re delicious♪
Rintaro|You people don’t have a care in the world, do you!? There’s some crazy stuff happening here!
Kurisu|Or it could all just be in your head. No need to panic.
Mayuri|You need Feris-chan for something? I wonder if she’s working today.
Itaru|Faris-tan’s off today.
Rintaro|You know her phone number, right? See if you can get ahold of her.
Mayuri|Okay!
Mayuri|Feris-chan? Good afternyan-nyan♪ It’s Mayushii, nyan♪
Kurisu|Nya, nyan...?
Mayuri|Sorry to bother you on your day off. Okarin said he wants to talk to you about something. Wanna talk to him?
Mayuri|Huh? You know. Okarin!
Mayuri|...Kyouma? Who’s Kyouma?
Mayuri|I’m handing you over, okay?
Mayuri|Here you go, Okarin.
Rintaro|It’s me. Hououin Kyouma.
Faris|Nyao♪ How unusual for Kyouma to contact me, nya.
Rintaro|There’s something I need to ask you.
Rintaro|Long ago, you donated a retro PC to Yanabayashi shrine. Am I mistaken?
Faris|Nyan.
Rintaro|What? What’s ’nyan’ supposed to mean, nya?
Faris|It means you’re right, nya. Though I didn’t know it was called the IBN 5100 until recently, nya.
Rintaro|What? Why recently?
Faris|Daru-nyan told me, nya.
Faris|So what about the retro PC, nya?
Rintaro|Ah, nothing...
Rintaro|Do you have any other information on the IBN 5100? It’s a super rare PC.
Rintaro|As a charisma-build maid, I expect you have a strong network in Akiba, correct? I’d like you to use that network and search for any IBN 5100s in Akiba now.
Faris|Hmnya...
Faris|I can look. But for a price, nya.
Rintaro|A price?
Rintaro|...Let’s hear it.
Faris|I want you to come over to Faris’s apartment, nya.
Rintaro|Where is this apartment of yours?
Rintaro|Oh, so you live in Akiba.
Faris|I’ll be waiting, nyan♪
Rintaro|...Well?
Rintaro|Why are you guys tagging along?
Mayuri|Mayushii’s never been to Feris-chan’s place.
Mayuri|I thought I’d like to visit once. Hehe♪
Itaru|I mean, it’s Faris-tan’s home. No way I’m missing this.
Rintaro|Mmm...?
Mayuri|What’s wrong?
Rintaro|What luck!
Rintaro|Hey, Shining Finger!
Moeka|I-B-N... I-B-N... I-B-N...
Moeka|Gonegonegone... why is it gone... why can’t I find it... is it really in this town... don’t tell me it’s already...
Rintaro|Are you listening, Shining Finger!?
Moeka|It should be... should be here... has to be... FB said so...
Rintaro|Kiryu Moeka!
Moeka|...Okabe-kun?
Rintaro|Did you take the IBN 5100 from the lab?
Rintaro|I don’t want to believe that it was you. You are a fellow lab mem, after all. But you did display an unhealthy attachment to that computer.
Rintaro|So, was it you?
Moeka|You... found an IBN 5100?
Rintaro|I found one, but it’s gone missing.
Moeka|Missing?
Rintaro|Don’t worry. I won’t report you to the police. As long as you return it, that is.
Moeka|...?
Rintaro|You... don’t remember, do you?
Rintaro|I’m sorry, Finger.
Rintaro|I suspected you. A lab mem! A comrade!
Rintaro|I’m the worst sort of man. Hit me, please. I don’t mind.
Rintaro|But there’s one thing I want you to know. In my long years running from the Organization, I’ve grown unable to trust anyone.
Rintaro|Once I start to suspect, everyone looks suspicious. No matter how many comrades gather around me, I always feel alone. Pitiful, aren’t I?
Rintaro|D-did you just ignore my entire speech?
Itaru|Hey, Okarin. You’re doing improv in the middle of the street. Has the heat gone to your head?
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|I’ve been thinking...
Mayuri|Moeka-san sure is pretty, isn’t she? She’s got a nice figure, and she’s tall, too!
Mayuri|She’d look great in one of my costumes. Ehehe!
Rintaro|Wh...at?
Rintaro|You’ve met Moeka before?
Mayuri|Sure I have!
Rintaro|When!?
Mayuri|Ummmmm?
Mayuri|When youuuuu brouuuught herrrr toooo theeee laaaaab!
Rintaro|I did...?
Rintaro|Daru. Do you remember her?
Itaru|Sure. We met at the lab.
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Okarin? We need to get going. Faris-chan’s waiting, remember?
Rintaro|By the way, Mayuri. What’s Faris’s real name?
Itaru|Whoa, Okarin! Hold on there! Faris-tan’s name is Faris NyanNyan. She doesn’t have any other names!
Rintaro|Face reality, Daru. Faris NyanNyan is just her professional name.
Itaru|Uwahh, you’re the worst! Why do you have to crush my dreams like that, man?
Rintaro|Well, Mayuri? Don’t you know?
Mayuri|Hmmm, is it okay for Mayushii to tell you?
Rintaro|It’s not like you took a vow of secrecy, right? And besides, we’re visiting her home, so we’ll find out soon enough.
Mayuri|Oh. I guess you’re right...
Mayuri|But just promise me you’ll keep it secret, okay? Like from the masters who come to MayQueen.
Mayuri|Okay. Feris-chan’s real name is Akiha Rumiho-chan!
Itaru|Nyah nyah nyah, not listening!
Rintaro|Akiha...
Mayuri|Waahh... awwwesome...
Itaru|Wait... seriously?
Rintaro|She lives... here?
Rintaro|Did we get the wrong address?
Rintaro|Don’t tell me Faris is working for the Organization!?
Rintaro|Does she have men in black waiting to haul us off to a re-education camp!?
Itaru|Nice delusion, man. The truth is stranger than fiction.
Itaru|Besides, don’t you think it would be super moe if Faris-tan turned out to be a ’rich girl’ character?
Rintaro|Nice delusion yourself, man.
Mayuri|Anyway, let’s go in!
Mayuri|A real live butler...
Butler|Mistress. Mr.Hououin Kyouma and friends have arrived.
Faris|Thanks, Kuroki nya.
Faris|Nyanya? Mayushii and Daru-nyan came too, nyan?
Mayuri|Feris-chan, good afternyan-nyan♪
Itaru|Mhmm, casual Faris-tan... too cute!
Rintaro|They followed me. If you don’t want them here, I’ll send them home.
Faris|No fur off my back, nya. Everyone’s welcome nyan♪
Rintaro|Wait, you talk like that even in your own home?
Faris|What do you mean, nya?
Rintaro|Gonna play dumb, Akiha Rumiho?
Faris|Faris is Faris, nya.
Rintaro|Fine. What I really want to know is how you get to live in a luxury apartment in Akiba’s best district!
Rintaro|Faris... just who are you?
Faris|Like I said, Faris is Faris, nyan.
Rintaro|Don’t play dumb. If you don’t explain yourself, I’m leaving!
Itaru|H-how arrogant... we’re the ones who came here to ask Faris-tan for a favor, aren’t we?
Faris|Hmmya... Well, if you must know...
Faris|This land originally belonged to my family, nya.
Rintaro|Hah?
Mayuri|Oh! So that’s why you’re Akiha-san!
Rintaro|Akiha... You mean you’re descended from the hereditary landholders of Akihabara!?
Faris|By the way, Faris has considerable influence on Akihabara’s development, nyan.
Faris|It was Faris who convinced the development board to actively promote moe culture in Akiba, nya.
Mayuri|Wow! That’s amazing!
Faris|I’ve been going to development meetings since I was little, nya.
Faris|But please keep all this a secret, nyan.
Rintaro|Why?
Faris|You wanna know, nya?
Faris|That’s because...
Faris|Faris is Faris, nya♪
Faris|I want all my fans to keep treating me the same as always, nyan☆
Itaru|I’ll treat you! I’ll treat you at full force!
Mayuri|Mayushii’s your fan too! Your maid spirit is really amazing!
Rintaro|I don’t care about any of this!
Rintaro|Do not defy me, Faris NyanNyan, or I’ll paint your expensive wallpaper with blood.
Rintaro|You called me to your home so you could show off your status and try to gain leverage in our negotiations. But it’s futile.
Rintaro|For you are dealing with the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!
Itaru|What kind of reason is that...
Faris|Nyan♪ Faris loves forceful men, nyan.
Itaru|What... did she say?
Faris|Honestly, Faris didn’t want to talk so much about herself, nya.
Faris|Most people, when they learn who I am, stop seeing me as Faris, nya. They only see the Akiha name.
Faris|Faris and Akiha Rumiho want to be seen as separate purrsons, nya.
Rintaro|There’s nothing to separate. You are Faris NyanNyan, are you not?
Faris|Nya?
Itaru|For once I agree with you, Okarin! Whenever she speaks NyanNyanian and wears her cat ears, she is Faris-tan!
Rintaro|You’re just being overly self-conscious, Faris.
Faris|I don’t know, nya...
Rintaro|I’m serious. To me, you will always be the unbeatable cat-eared maid!
Faris|Nyahaha. Thanks, Kyouma.
Rintaro|Faris, you said there would be a price to pay in exchange for your help acquiring an IBN 5100. What is your price?
Rintaro|Do not test the limits of my good will.
Rintaro|If I unseal my right arm for even an instant, everything will be destroyed, and nothing will remain... just so you know.
Faris|Fine by me, nya.
Faris|These cat ears have the power to negate all other powers -- NyanNyan Clear.
Faris|When Kyouma’s power is unleashed, Faris will stop it, nya.
Rintaro|...
Faris|Well, I guess I’ll tell you, nya.
Faris|My price...
Faris|Is to let me use your time machine, nya.
Faris|I heard what you said at MayQueen yesterday. You’ve built a time machine.
Rintaro|Indeed. We have created the first successful time machine in human history.
Itaru|Uh, SERN was the first.
Rintaro|But don’t misunderstand.
Rintaro|We call it a time machine, but it’s not the kind you can hop into and fly to whenever you want.
Rintaro|All we can do is send a 36-byte email to someone’s phone in the past.
Rintaro|But even that is worthy of a Nobel Prize in physics. It is a transcendental super invention that will alter the course of human history forever.
Faris|It can send an email to someone in the past? That’s awesome! Faris wants to use it, nya!
Rintaro|The time machine is our lab’s greatest secret. If you want to use it, then you must become a lab mem.
Faris|A lab mem? What’s that, nya?
Mayuri|Well, it means you get to be a part of our club♪ Mayushii would be super happy if Feris-chan became a lab mem!
Itaru|Same here!
Itaru|That would be AWWWWWRIGHT!
Itaru|Please join! I’m begging here!
Faris|How do I become a lab mem, nya?
Rintaro|There’s no contract. We only require that you perform... the blood oath.
Faris|The... blood oath!!
Rintaro|Faris NyanNyan, if thou dost desire to join the hallowed order of lab mems, then by the code passed down in High Ancient from an age long forgotten...
Rintaro|Pledge thy flesh, thy bone, thy blood, and thy soul to the Grail of Heaven, and swear fealty everlasting!
Rintaro|This duty fulfilled, the old gods shall grant thee thy lab mem number.
Itaru|I didn’t understand a word of that...
Mayuri|Oh no! What do I do? Mayushii never ate any blood loaf. Does that mean Mayushii’s not a lab mem?
Itaru|Don’t worry, Mayu-shi. This is just Okarin’s usual nonsense.
Mayuri|Oh! I guess everything’s fine then♪ Thank goodness!
Faris|Very well, nya. I shall take the blood oath, nya...
Rintaro|--!?
Mayuri|No!
Itaru|Uh, isn’t that a paper knife?
Faris|Nyahaha♪ Daru-nyan’s right, nya!
Rintaro|Very well, Faris, I invest you as Lab Mem 007.
Faris|Purrfect. So now can I use the time machine, nya?
Rintaro|Indeed. But not a word to anyone. Death to traitors. That’s the law of the lab.
Mayuri|It is?
Itaru|No. Okarin made it up just now.
Faris|Thanks, Kyouma!
Itaru|Okarin, you jerk! I helped make the PhoneWave too!
Faris|Really nya? Then Daru-nyan too!
Mayuri|I’m glad she’s so happy, Okarin♪
Rintaro|Heh heh heh... Mayuri, you really are innocent.
Mayuri|Hweh?
Rintaro|It’s me. ...Yeah, I’ve got her wrapped around my finger. What did you expect? She’s just a 17-year-old girl.
Rintaro|That catgirl thinks she’s bargained with me to appease her lust for mankind’s dream, the forbidden fruit that is the time machine.
Rintaro|But she’s dancing to the tune of Hououin Kyouma!
Rintaro|...Hmph, why did I agree to pay her price, you ask? That should be obvious.
Rintaro|That catgirl shall be our guinea pig.
Rintaro|...I’m a monster? What a terrible thing to say. Not that you’re wrong, exactly. Heh heh heh.
Mayuri|...?
Rintaro|Right. Faris thinks she’s using us...
Rintaro|But it is we who are using her! She is but a moth drawn to my brilliant flame. Muhahaha!
Rintaro|As planned, we are proceeding to the next phase of the experiment. This is the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo.
Rintaro|Mmgh!?
Faris|Who were you talking to, nya?
Rintaro|It’s too late, Faris NyanNyan.
Rintaro|You’ve already taken the blood oath. If you break it, ruin will befall you.
Rintaro|There is no escape.
Faris|Ok, nya. So where’s the time machine, nya?
Rintaro|The time machine -- its name is the PhoneWave (name subject to change), by the way -- is in our lab.
Mayuri|Umm, so does that mean it has to keep going for 86,000 seconds?
Mayuri|Won’t PhoneWave-chan get tired?
Rintaro|It doesn’t actually have to run the entire duration.
Rintaro|The mail reaches the past if you send it as soon as the discharge begins.
Rintaro|In accordance with the Butterfly Effect, the remaining seconds should be canceled out. The experiment never happened.
Kurisu|Hallo.
Rintaro|It’s me. What’s the situation?
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|She hung up on me!
Itaru|Of course she did. Mayu-shi and I are the only ones who can deal with your act, you know?
Kurisu|Hallo.
Rintaro|It’s Hououin Kyouma. Don’t hang up.
Kurisu|Oh, it’s Okabe. I was sure it was a prank call.
Rintaro|It shows you my number, doesn’t it!?
Kurisu|You were talking crazy, so I got scared and hung up.
Rintaro|In other words, you fear the insanity of Hououin Kyouma! Well, I suppose you can’t be blamed for--
Rintaro|She hung up! Again!
Itaru|Like I said, we’re the only ones who can put up with you...
Kurisu|Hallo.
Rintaro|This is Okabe Rintaro. Sorry, but could you mess with the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s settings a little, please?
Kurisu|Well why didn’t you say so?
Kurisu|Hmm... you’re going to use the PhoneWave? I don’t want to anger the guy downstairs, though.
Rintaro|We’re about to perform a critical experiment. Understand, assistant? Mister Braun might yell at you, but that small sacrifice will bring mankind’s dream, the time machine, to fruition.
Kurisu|You’re really irresponsible, you know that?
Kurisu|...Well? What should I set it to?
Kurisu|Okay, it’s ready.
Rintaro|Alright, thanks. Wait a bit.
Rintaro|Finished writing what you want to send?
Rintaro|What did you write? You sure it’s something that’ll change the past?
Faris|W-well...
Faris|I-it’s embarrassing, nya! A trade secret, nyan!
Rintaro|A secret!? Nonsense! This is science! Unless we know what you’re sending, we can’t verify the results!
Faris|What’s that supposed to mean!? No one said anything about science, nya! I’m using the time machine for myself, not science, nya!
Rintaro|That’s not fair!
Itaru|You’re one to talk.
Kurisu|Hey, Okabe. How long are you gonna make me wait?
Mayuri|Um, Okarin, it’s probably something private, so I don’t think you should pry...
Rintaro|Mmmgh...
Kurisu|Okabe? If you’re not gonna send anything, I’m hanging up.
Rintaro|W-wait! Fine. Activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Kurisu|The discharge is starting.
Faris|Click, nya!
Rintaro|...
Itaru|Okay. Card Open.
Mayuri|Oh no! Another Virus Card!
Faris|Not so fast, nyan♪
Mayuri|Awww... You took three Link Cards, right? And I got three Virus Cards, right?
Mayuri|Mayushii’s in trouble...
Itaru|We still have a Terminal Card. We can turn the tables next turn.
Faris|Nyahaha♪ It’s way too late for that, nya. Faris is going to use the Terminal Card, Virus Checker, nya.
Faris|So, which is Mayushii’s last Virus Card, nya?
Mayuri|Oh no...
Itaru|You’re a monster, Faris-tan.
Mayuri|H-hey, could you wait one... no, two or three turns, nya? Please, nya?
Faris|Nyaha♪ Not even if you try to copycat Faris, nyan.
Mayuri|No way!
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Phew... Feris-chan is really strong.
Faris|Mayushii started out strong, nya. You have potential, nyan.
Faris|But don’t think I’ll go easy on you just because we’re playing for fun, nyan!
Faris|Besides, I promised Papa that I’d win the next tournyament, nya! I can’t lose to anyone before then, nyan!
Mayuri|Papa?
Faris|Papa said that if Faris won, he’d take time off work to congratulate me, nyan.
Itaru|I want to congratulate you too. Are you free that night?
Faris|Papa and I are having dinner that night, nya.
Itaru|Oh...
Mayuri|You know, we should all go cheer at the finals!
Faris|Thanks nya♪
Itaru|Isn’t your final opponent the Viral Attackers duo?
Itaru|No one had heard of them until they defeated Faris-tan’s rivals, Idiyona.
Itaru|Faris-tan’s duels with Idiyona were all god tier, so I was looking forward to it.
Faris|I haven’t seen any other RaiNetter matches, but are the Viral Attackers really that furrocious?
Itaru|Well, they’re not a threat to Faris-tan. Faris-tan is the strongest. Faris-tan is a goddess!
Faris|Nyan♪ Stop it, nya. You’re embarrassing me, nya!
Rintaro|...
Faris’ Dad|Excuse me. Rumiho. Do you have a minute?
Faris|Papa!
Itaru|Whoa, Faris-tan’s dad... Shouldn’t we say hello?
Mayuri|He’s a CEO, right? Wow...
Rintaro|...
Faris|Sorry nya! Faris has to go out with Papa, nya.
Mayuri|Okay. I guess we’ll see you later, then.
Itaru|But Faris-tan, what about my match? You promised to give me a hands-on lesson -- you know, really work me over.
Faris|Pretty sure I didn’t, nya.
Itaru|Of course you didn’t... I was just making it up...
Mayuri|Daru-kun, you shouldn’t trouble Feris-chan like that.
Mayuri|Come on, Okarin. Let’s go back to the lab.
Rintaro|Yeah.
Faris|You know, Kyouma’s been awfully quiet, nya. Something wrong, nyan?
Rintaro|Nothing. I was just looking at Akiba, watching the ignorant masses scurry about in search of momentary surcease from the pain of existence.
Itaru|That’s Okarin for you... batshit crazy.
Rintaro|Huh? Where’d Mayuri go?
Itaru|Huh? You’re right. She’s gone.
Rintaro|Mayuri, where are you going!?
Mayuri|Okarin! Um, Mayushii was thinking about stopping by Nakano Broadway before going home.
Rintaro|If you’re going home, then why didn’t you say so?
Mayuri|Ehehe. Sorry. All I could think about was going to Nakano.
Itaru|Mayu-shi’s like some kinda ninja. Never noticed she was gone.
Rintaro|What business do you have in Nakano, anyway?
Mayuri|Well, a Sorrow Sword doujinshi came out yesterday.
Itaru|Porn?
Mayuri|No, but the illustrator is Kouga Yui-san. Mayushii thinks it’s finally time to get serious about costumes again.
Itaru|Kouga Yui? She was the character designer for last year’s Gunbam.
Mayuri|Yup!
Itaru|Buy me one too.
Mayuri|Okey dokey♪
Rintaro|What are you guys talking about? If you want doujinshi, why not go to Toranoana? It’s right over there.
Mayuri|There, where?
Rintaro|You know, there! Right over--
Rintaro|Wha...?
Rintaro|Where the hell did Toranoana and Animate go!?
Itaru|Have you lost it, man?
Rintaro|Huh?
Mayuri|There aren’t any Toranoanas or Animates in Akiba. That’s why Mayushii’s going to Nakano to buy doujinshi.
Rintaro|What do you mean there aren’t any!? They were there yesterday, weren’t they!?
Itaru|There’s no moe stores in Akiba, man. You know that. The holy land of moe is Nakano.
Rintaro|But Akiba is the holy land of moe! The whole world knows that!
Itaru|Has the heat finally gone to your head, Okarin? Akiba is the electric town. If you opened a moe store here, the electronics otaku would riot.
Rintaro|What about Mandarake?
Mayuri|Nope.
Rintaro|Akiba-o!?
Itaru|Of course there’s an Akiba-o.
Rintaro|I mean Akiba-okoku, where they sell doujinshi!
Itaru|The hell’s that?
Mayuri|They sell doujinshi at Akiba-o?
Itaru|Of course not. That would be crazy.
Rintaro|Gamers!? Ramutara!?
Rintaro|MelonBooks!? Asobit City!?
Rintaro|Chaos has forsaken this place...
Rintaro|It’s gone...
Rintaro|Mayuri. You work at MayQueen, don’t you?
Mayuri|MayQueen? What’s that? A potato?
Rintaro|MayQueen+Nyan²!
Mayuri|Mayushii works at Lemoine, remember?
Rintaro|Lemoine? Is that a maid cafe?
Mayuri|It’s just a normal coffee shop.
Rintaro|Is there even a single maid cafe in Akiba?
Itaru|Naw man. The people here hate moe businesses. Nobody would go.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|What the hell?
Rintaro|Is it the Organization? SERN?
Rintaro|It’s Sunday. Obon weekend. What are you doing here, lab girls?
Luka|Pardon the intrusion, Okabe-san.
Mayuri|Good morning, Okarin♪
Rintaro|What are you doing?
Mayuri|Yesterday I went to Nakano to buy doujinshi, remember? While I was there, I found a photo album of a super cute cosplayer!
Mayuri|So I splurged on it♪
Mayuri|Look, Luka-chan! This is a costume of Sedona from Blood Tune. It’s so detailed and cute!
Luka|It is!
Mayuri|Take a look, Chris-chan! It’s amazing!
Kurisu|I’m okay.
Mayuri|Wow, look at these swimsuits! So much skin! She’s got a great figure, like a gravure idol.
Luka|Must be nice...
Mayuri|Nice? The swimsuits?
Luka|I... don’t have that great a figure...
Mayuri|Don’t worry, Luka-chan. I’m sure you’ll make our big friends breathe hard.
Mayuri|And um, plenty of people like flat chests. So even if you don’t have breasts, you should still have confidence in yourself.
Kurisu|Khmmkhmmkhmm!
Mayuri|I know! Once ComiMa’s over, let’s all go on a trip to the beach! Mayushii’s been making costumes all summer. I haven’t had time to play at all.
Mayuri|What do you think, guys? A lab mem beach trip!
Luka|Um... all of the lab mems?
Kurisu|I can’t go. I have to go back to America soon, and I haven’t even started packing yet.
Rintaro|Yes, I can see you’re in a rush. I bet you don’t even have time to lounge around and read.
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|Fine, I’ll be blunt. There’s no way I’m swimming with two perverts like you!
Kurisu|If it’s just the girl members, I’ll happily go.
Rintaro|Hmph. Be honest, Christina. You just don’t want me to see the Mongolian Spot on your butt!
Kurisu|I don’t have a Mongolian Spot!
Rintaro|Anyway, if it’s just the girl members, then doesn’t that rule out Lukako?
Kurisu|What’s that supposed to mean?
Rintaro|Didn’t we tell you earlier? Lukako is a bonafide guy! 
Kurisu|You’re the worst. Where do you get off calling her a guy?
Mayuri|Yeah, Okarin. That’s a terrible thing to say.
Luka|...
Rintaro|Christina. I understand your desire to deny the truth. It’s difficult to imagine that a guy could ever be so cute, but--
Kurisu|Okabe!
Kurisu|If you want to give me stupid nicknames, that’s fine -- I mean, it’s not, but...
Kurisu|What you said just now is below the belt.
Kurisu|I didn’t take you for the kind of guy who thinks it’s funny to hurt people’s feelings, but I guess I was wrong. You’re a real jerk, Okabe.
Rintaro|Huh?
Kurisu|Apologize. Apologize to Urushibara-san right now.
Rintaro|Wait a second. I don’t have to apologize for anything. I just said the tru--
Luka|It’s okay.
Luka|So that’s how Okabe-san sees me...
Rintaro|No no no! That’s not how I see you, Lukako. You’re a guy, remember!? Or are you denying reality too!?
Kurisu|You’re the one denying reality!
Mayuri|That’s right! Luka-chan’s a girl, Okarin. You’re terrible.
Rintaro|Mayuri, when did you start calling Lukako ’Luka-chan’ instead of ’Luka-kun’?
Kurisu|Cut it out already, Okabe! She’s a girl!
Luka|I’m going home!
Rintaro|Hold it, Lukako! You can’t fool me! You’re as much a man as I am! And I know how to prove it!
Rintaro|Oh...?
Luka|ah...
Kurisu|You...
Mayuri|Awawa...
Rintaro|Ohhhh? Huh? What? Why?
Luka|Ugh, no, don’t... Okabe-san, please... stop... sniff.
Rintaro|Lukako, you...
Rintaro|You’re a girl!?
Kurisu|That’s what we’ve been saying!
Luka|hic... ugg... egh...
Kurisu|I want to vivisect your skull and remove your brain for a good washing.
Kurisu|Then I’ll submerge it in culture fluid so you can never do anything like that again!
Kurisu|Anyway, just be thankful I haven’t reported you to the police.
Rintaro|Yes ma’am. I’m sorry.
Kurisu|Anyway, what in the hell made you think that Urushibara-san was a boy?
Rintaro|Heh heh heh... as I already explained, we changed the past. Lukako was a guy, but he wanted to be a girl, so we sent a D-Mail to make his wish come true. And it worked!
Rintaro|I knew the worldline had changed. My magic eye, Reading Steiner, saw the shift in time.
Rintaro|But I chose to believe my mundane senses instead. I should have had more faith in my powers! I won’t make that mistake again.
Kurisu|Want some more?
Rintaro|I’m telling the truth. You have to believe me!
Rintaro|I can explain this phenomenon logically. When we sent the D-Mail, we changed the past, and all of history changed as a result. My brain perceived that change!
Rintaro|Out of all mankind, I alone can perceive changes in causality! I am this world’s observer!
Kurisu|Sit down before I hit you again.
Rintaro|Don’t you understand? I’m the observer, the one who opens the box holding Schrodinger’s cat.
Mayuri|Shredding Gar?
Itaru|Schrodinger’s cat again?
Itaru|The Japanese can’t get enough of that cat.
Kurisu|You’re Japanese too.
Itaru|I’ve had enough Schrodinger, thanks. I do admit that kittehs are cute, though.
Rintaro|Gh...
Rintaro|Anyway, my magic eye has the power to perceive changes in the worldline. This power is called Reading Steiner, as I’ve explained.
Kurisu|And I told you that that name was stupid, remember?
Kurisu|It’s Engrish, like something from a kid’s manga.
Kurisu|Not to mention it’s a grammatical mess, and there’s also the fact that it’s half German, so no consistency there either. It’s stupid.
Kurisu|The same goes for that ’Steins Gate’ thing you’re always talking about.
Rintaro|Heh heh heh... looks like you’ve still got that Mongolian Spot on your butt. Eh, Christina?
Rintaro|Names are all about feeling! My creativity, comparable to the great Da Vinci himself, cannot be held by the shackles of grammar! Muhah--
Kurisu|Show a little remorse, huh?
Rintaro|I’m sorry...
Suzuha|...Sup.
Suzuha|Why are you so wobbly?
Rintaro|It’s... a new exercise.
Suzuha|Huh. Never heard of it.
Suzuha|Perfect weather for cycling.
Rintaro|Really?
Suzuha|Hey, up for a little cycling?
Rintaro|Your bike only has one seat.
Suzuha|One of us can sit on the back.
Rintaro|Don’t you have work to do?
Suzuha|I got permission. It’s not like we’ll have customers anyway.
Rintaro|Huff... huff... I am a mad scientist... not a mad... cyclist...
Rintaro|Huff... huff... so why... am I... doing the pedaling?
Suzuha|Long ago, Aristotle said, ’time is just the measure of motion.’
Suzuha|So put those pedals in motion.
Suzuha|You know...
Suzuha|It’s only been ten days since I arrived in Tokyo.
Rintaro|Vacation? No... that can’t be right.
Suzuha|I’m hunting for my father.
Rintaro|Did he run away?
Suzuha|...
Suzuha|I haven’t seen him in years. But I know he’s in this town.
Rintaro|Oh... but then why are you working downstairs?
Suzuha|Honestly, I don’t have a clue where to begin.
Rintaro|Have you talked to the police?
Suzuha|...No.
Rintaro|Then shouldn’t you? Or you could hire a private investigator or something, if you have money.
Suzuha|I don’t have the resources. And besides, there are... issues.
Suzuha|I only have one chance.
Suzuha|And that chance is tomorrow.
Suzuha|I know that tomorrow, he might appear in a certain place.
Suzuha|If I miss that chance, then I’ll have to leave.
Rintaro|By leave, you mean go back home?
Suzuha|Not exactly. I have a parallel, priority engagement.
Suzuha|I’ve already made up my mind. I don’t find him tomorrow, I’ll give up.
Rintaro|You’re worried, aren’t you?
Suzuha|...
Rintaro|I understand that feeling. You’re alone, searching for your father in an unfamiliar town. It can’t be easy.
Rintaro|You hoped that talking to someone would help. That’s why you sought out the most reliable person around -- me.
Rintaro|Alas, Part-Time Warrior, you have made a grave mistake. For I am the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma!
Suzuha|Uh...
Rintaro|Heh heh heh... you shall be my next guinea pig!
Suzuha|Guinea pig?
Rintaro|You know what I’m talking about. D-Mail, the greatest discovery in the history of science!
Rintaro|You shall be the subject of our next experiment. Heh heh heh.
Suzuha|Wh-what are you gonna do?
Rintaro|Do? Simple. I need more data, and I’ll do anything to obtain it.
Rintaro|You’re going to change the past. You can change it however you like, but only I will know the difference!
Rintaro|If you think that’s cruel, then do as you please. But know that you are already caught in my web. You cannot escape.
Rintaro|Fear not! I know exactly what you should write in your D-Mail.
Rintaro|Heh heh heh... listen well. You’re going to send this to your father before he disappeared.
Rintaro|’Don’t abandon your daughter.’ Muhahahaha!
Suzuha|...You’re a nice guy. You know that?
Rintaro|Wh...at?
Suzuha|I think talking to you really did help.
Rintaro|Are you trying to insult me? I am not a nice guy. I am a mad scientist who experiments on women and children!
Rintaro|Now tell me your father’s email address! If you don’t...
Rintaro|Then I shall unleash the power of my right arm! Once it’s unsealed, not even I can control it. You may not survive. Consider yourself warned.
Suzuha|Sorry. I can’t.
Rintaro|You dare defy me!?
Suzuha|I don’t know his email address or his phone number.
Rintaro|...Oh.
Suzuha|That’s why tomorrow’s my only chance. Thanks for caring, though.
Rintaro|I don’t care. I’m just disappointed I couldn’t experiment on you.
Suzuha|Anyway, you can send mail to the past? That’s amazing! The first time machine ever!
Rintaro|Hmph, of course it’s amazing. I am Hououin Kyouma!
Suzuha|Any plans to upgrade it?
Rintaro|Upgrade it?
Suzuha|You know, like sending people to the past or something.
Rintaro|We’re working on it.
Suzuha|Then let me give you one word of advice.
Suzuha|You should leave Makise Kurisu out of it.
Rintaro|What do you have against her, anyway?
Suzuha|...
Suzuha|Welp. Better get back to the workshop.
Suzuha|I only got a 30-minute break. I’ll get in trouble if I don’t get back soon.
Rintaro|Come to the lab tomorrow, whether you meet your father or not.
Suzuha|Why?
Rintaro|So I can use your grief to power my time machine. Heh heh heh!
Suzuha|Ahaha! You really are a mad scientist. So eeeevil!
Suzuha|If I meet my father, I’ll stop by. Then we can do a gun salute!
Rintaro|Hey, wait! Let me on! Hey!
Rintaro|I shall now brief you on Operation Eldhrimnir.
Rintaro|I want you guys to get ready for a party.
Kurisu|And what are you going to do?
Rintaro|Me? I’m going to follow that Part-Time Warrior and report back as the situation changes.
Kurisu|Don’t you dare. Let her be alone with her father.
Rintaro|Heh heh heh. You shouldn’t be so quick to reject my plans, Christina. You don’t understand the intricacies of the human psyche.
Rintaro|Now that you’ve rejected my plan, there’s no way I’m not going through with it! You have underestimated my pride!
Kurisu|Get over yourself.
Rintaro|Besides, Christina, you and she are enemies, are you not? You protect her from me while plotting her demise? That makes you a hypocrite!
Kurisu|You just don’t have standards, that’s all.
Mayuri|She’s right. I don’t think you should bother her, Okarin.
Mayuri|No matter what happens, we need to give her a waaaarm welcome. I’ll do anything to help make this party super special.
Luka|Um, actually, I haven’t met this Suzuha-san...
Mayuri|Suzu-san’s really nice. I’m sure you’ll get along with her too!
Kurisu|Nice?
Rintaro|Anyway, I’m going to tail her now. You guys--
Kurisu|No! Get it through your thick skull!
Rintaro|Dammit, assistant! How dare you give me orders!?
Kurisu|Don’t even think about running off somewhere.
Kurisu|Anyway...
Kurisu|I hope Amane-san finds her father.
Rintaro|Yeah.
Kurisu|That would be... nice.
Kurisu|Hey, Okabe...
Kurisu|I’m sorry about before.
Rintaro|Before?
Kurisu|When I hit you with my book. I thought you were just being a pervert.
Kurisu|But when I thought about it later, I realized that you were being completely serious.
Kurisu|But I acted on impulse, without even considering what you had to say.
Rintaro|Forget it. Regardless of my intentions, the fact of the matter is that I made Lukako cry.
Kurisu|Just to make sure, you’re not a perverted scumbag, are you?
Rintaro|Make sure, my ass! Are you trying to apologize or what!?
Kurisu|I just don’t want to you to use science as an excuse to be a pervert. Not while I’m helping, at least.
Rintaro|What do you take me for?
Rintaro|My friends are precious to me.
Rintaro|I may be an insane mad scientist with an IQ of 170, but even I have my limits.
Rintaro|The PhoneWave (name subject to change) wouldn’t have come this far without you and Daru at my side.
Kurisu|Okabe...
Rintaro|I am Lab Mem 001, the founder of the lab.
Rintaro|If my friends are in danger, I’ll rush to their aid. And I would tear my own limbs off before I knowingly brought harm to any of you.
Kurisu|Pff...
Rintaro|What’s so funny?
Kurisu|That has to be the cheesiest thing you’ve ever said.
Rintaro|Hmph...
Kurisu|Still, it’s nice to hear.
Kurisu|The research institute I work at in America is full of talented people from all over the world... but it’s not a friendly place.
Kurisu|Everyone thinks he or she is the best. You think you have an ego? Over there, scientists hurl insults at each other on a daily basis. Sometimes they even sabotage each other’s work.
Kurisu|When my thesis was chosen to represent the lab, many of the older men complained.
Kurisu|And when I came back here as a kind of reverse exchange student, my classmates were all too afraid to talk to me.
Kurisu|Compared to that, your lab is childish... but comfortable.
Kurisu|You’re really concerned about Amane-san, aren’t you? That part of you, I can respect.
Kurisu|B-but I’m not praising you, okay?
Kurisu|I just... you know... thought you should know...
Rintaro|Maybe I...
Kurisu|Eh?
Rintaro|Maybe all I ever wanted was friends.
Kurisu|Okabe...
Rintaro|There aren’t many people I can trust...
Kurisu|I, um... think of you as a friend too.
Rintaro|...What?
Kurisu|You said I was your friend, remember? You said I was important to you.
Kurisu|That made me really... happy, I guess.
Rintaro|Do you have a fever?
Kurisu|No!
Kurisu|What the hell!? Here I am trying to find something decent about you, and you... I don’t care anymore, stupid!
Kurisu|You’re really... stupid.
Kurisu|Huh? Over there, isn’t that...
Rintaro|Found you, Daru!
Itaru|Huh? Ah--
Rintaro|Why didn’t you respond to my summons?
Itaru|Like I said, I’ve got something to do.
Rintaro|Which is?
Itaru|An offline meet...
Rintaro|Inexcusable.
Itaru|Wait, just listen a sec--
Rintaro|Your offline meet, or a party with food handmade by our very own lab girls. Choose one.
Itaru|Handmade... by girls?
Itaru|O-one question. Will Faris-tan be there?
Rintaro|Naturally. Faris is a lab mem too. Heh heh heh.
Itaru|Dammit! Why do they have to be on the same day!? Can’t it wait until tomorrow?
Rintaro|What will it be? The time to choose is now.
Itaru|I want to eat Faris-tan’s home cooking...
Rintaro|If you give up the offline meet, then that settles it.
Itaru|I give up. I give up the offline meeeet!
Mayuri|Huh? Daru-kun’s here too?
Itaru|What about Faris-tan? Where is she?
Kurisu|You’ve been tricked.
Mayuri|Feris-chan said she couldn’t come.
Itaru|Wait, seriously!? Okarin! What’s going on here!? This isn’t funny, man!
Rintaro|Don’t worry. I’ll make sure she comes to the next one.
Itaru|You’ve gotta be kidding me! I was looking forward to that time machine meet...
Kurisu|Time machine meet? What’s that?
Itaru|It’s an offline meet for this sci-fi BBS I post on.
Itaru|Some famous writers are going to be there. I won’t forgive you, Okarin. Ever.
Rintaro|What? Why didn’t you say so? I would’ve gone too!
Rintaro|...Does anyone else smell that?
Kurisu|Smell what?
Rintaro|Did we blow a fuse somewhere?
Luka|S-sorry...
Luka|That’s probably the smell of... Mayuri’s cooking...
Kurisu|I’ll help too.
Luka|Okay, then warm these eggs please.
Kurisu|Hm. Should I use the PhoneWave?
Luka|N-no! If you put raw eggs in a microwave, they’ll explode!
Kurisu|We took the door off. It should be fine, right?
Mayuri|Chop, chop, choppity chop, chop, chop, choppity...
Luka|M-Mayuri-chan! Don’t hold your knife like that!
Rintaro|Maybe we should help too. Or at least kick them out of the kitchen?
Itaru|Won’t it end up the same either way?
Rintaro|I’m getting dizzy. This isn’t the future I was hoping for.
Itaru|You’re telling me. I’ll never forget this, Okarin. Never.
Rintaro|I’m sorry. Truly. But please, Daru, stay with me to the end.
Itaru|I’ll order pizza as insurance.
Rintaro|It’s me. Looks like the Evil One is free. If you haven’t heard from me in an hour... tell my parents I love them.
Itaru|Okarin, that’s a death flag...
Rintaro|Is this the choice of Steins Gate? El Psy Kongroo...
Itaru|Hwahhhh...
Mayuri|...
Kurisu|...
Luka|...
Rintaro|...She’s late.
Rintaro|...!
Rintaro|Hououin Kyouma will never accept that! She will be my guinea pig whether she likes it or not!
Rintaro|...!
Rintaro|You there! Part-Time Warrior!
Rintaro|Wait!
Suzuha|...You’re a nice guy. You know that?
Suzuha|I think talking to you really did help.
Rintaro|...!?
Mayuri|Okarin! Did you find Suzu-san?
Rintaro|It’s late. Go home, everyone.
Luka|But...
Kurisu|Tell us what happened.
Itaru|Yeah. Keep us in the loop, man.
Rintaro|Suzuha ran away from me. I guess she couldn’t find her father.
Mayuri|Oh...
Rintaro|Heh... heh heh heh...
Rintaro|MUHAHAHAHA!
Luka|O-Okabe-san? What’s wrong? Are you okay?
Kurisu|His brain is probably oxygen-starved from too much running.
Itaru|Okarin... chill.
Rintaro|Heh, look at you all!
Rintaro|Why the long faces, friends!?
Rintaro|Have you forgotten? We have just the thing for moments like these!
Kurisu|You’re going to send a D-Mail?
Itaru|But the discharge phenomenon won’t occur this late, will it?
Rintaro|Then we’ll send it tomorrow.
Mayuri|Who are you sending it to?
Rintaro|To myself this afternoon. The message...
Rintaro|Don’t listen to Christina. Pursue Suzuha!’
Rintaro|...Good morning, Part-Time Warrior.
Suzuha|Sup.
Rintaro|Slacking off?
Suzuha|It’s not like anyone’s gonna come.
Suzuha|And besides, I was up all night partying.
Suzuha|I’m really tired.
Rintaro|You were partying? With who?
Suzuha|Were you drinking, Okabe Rintaro?
Suzuha|Big no-no. You’re only eighteen.
Rintaro|You couldn’t find your father, so we held the ’Last Supper’ to make you a test subject. Correct?
Suzuha|Ahaha! Yeah, I remember you saying something like that.
Suzuha|Thanks for all your help yesterday.
Rintaro|...My memory’s a bit fuzzy. Remind me again how we captured you.
Suzuha|Wait, were you really drinking last night?
Rintaro|Just tell me.
Suzuha|Well, I was on my way home from the time machine meet when--
Rintaro|Woah, wait a second. Time machine meet!?
Suzuha|Yup.
Rintaro|Was that where your father was supposed to appear?
Suzuha|I said so yesterday, didn’t I?
Rintaro|So you were going home, and then?
Suzuha|You, Hashida Itaru, and Shiina Mayuri appeared out of nowhere.
Suzuha|You brought me to the lab, and we partied all night long.
Suzuha|Yesterday sure was fun...
Suzuha|It would’ve been more fun if not for Makise Kurisu. The apple pie she made was deadly.
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|But Urushibara Luka’s curry was awesome.
Suzuha|Your lab seems kinda like... umm... like a clubhouse? It’s nice.
Suzuha|Everyone gets along, and you’re always smiling...
Suzuha|I’ve never had so much fun in my life.
Rintaro|Part-Time Warrior. As promised, you are now my test subject.
Suzuha|But I already told you. I don’t know his email address.
Rintaro|Then we’ll have to postpone the experiment until you find out.
Rintaro|By the way, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) used in the experiment is our lab’s greatest secret. You must become a lab mem to guarantee your silence.
Suzuha|Lab mem?
Rintaro|Short for laboratory member. When you become a lab mem, you become one of us.
Suzuha|...Can I really join?
Rintaro|You don’t have a choice in the matter! From this day forth, you are Lab Mem 008!
Suzuha|I guess I don’t have a choice, huh? I’m all yours.
Rintaro|...You’re not going to leave?
Suzuha|Nope. Maybe there’s still a chance to find my dad.
Rintaro|You are a lab mem now. If there’s anything we can do, you need only ask.
Rintaro|By the way, do you have any leads?
Suzuha|My father calls himself Titor.
Rintaro|Wait, Titor? As in that Titor!?
Suzuha|You know about him? He might be using a different codename, though.
Rintaro|Look! There’s someone posting named John Titor!
Rintaro|This solves the puzzle! Your father is on @channel!
Suzuha|Huh... you’re right.
Rintaro|Hey. Shouldn’t you be more surprised?
Suzuha|Well... it’s not him.
Rintaro|How do you know? You just said your father calls himself Titor!
Suzuha|I can tell. This Titor isn’t my dad.
Suzuha|His name’s not John. The name my father used was...
Suzuha|Barrel Titor.
Mayuri|This is the Earth, you know? 70 million years ago.
Mayuri|Some scary people sent you here in a time machine.
Mayuri|Mayushii went looking for you, and found Okarins from many, maaaany worldlines.
Mayuri|You’re one of many Okarins, and also the original.
Mayuri|Mayushii is one of many Mayushiis, and also the original.
Mayuri|And now, Okarin and Mayushii are going to die here.
Mayuri|But...
Mayuri|I know that another Okarin and Mayushii will pick up where we left off, 70 million years in the future.
Mayuri|So everything’s A-OK♪
Rintaro|This... is a dream!
Rintaro|Guh!
Rintaro|...It was a dream.
Mayuri|I wish I had an Upa...
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|This is Hououin Kyouma.
Faris|Nyaon♪ It’s Faris, nyan.
Rintaro|Oh, it’s you, Akiha Rumiho.
Faris|Nya? Who’s that, nya?
Faris|Faris is Faris, nya. I don’t have any other names, nya.
Rintaro|Yeah, right. Your True Name is Faris. My apologies.
Rintaro|Well, what is it?
Faris|You’ve been too conspicuous, nya. The cat’s outta the bag, and now you’re trapped, nya.
Rintaro|Hah?
Faris|The Four Guardian Kings have awakened, nya. There’s no escape, nyan.
Rintaro|Heh. Is that so? If you think the Four Guardian Kings can stop me, just wait and see. Akiba will be drowning in blood before nightfall.
Faris|After the Four Guardian Kings are the Four Guardian Queens, nya. After that, it’s the Eight Devils, and then the Black Angel Twelve, nya.
Rintaro|Th-that many!? What’s going on in this town...
Faris|You’ve really stirred up a hornet’s nest, nya. I’m sorry, Kyouma, but this is checkmate, nyan.
Rintaro|No, it’s not over yet. If I can just acquire the item, I can turn the tide!
Rintaro|Have you still not located an IBN 5100!?
Faris|Sorry, nya. I have agents looking all over the world, but still no luck, nya.
Rintaro|Please hurry. I’m running out of time.
Faris|Okay, nya! I’ll tell you as soon as I find one, Kyouma. Until then... hold on to your nine lives, nyan.
Rintaro|Yeah, I can’t die yet... El Psy Ko--
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Mayushii here.
Mayuri|Ah, Feris-chan. Good mornyan♪
Mayuri|Kyouma? Oh, you mean Okarin? Yup, he’s here. Wanna talk to him?
Mayuri|Hmm? Um, it looks like he can’t talk.
Mayuri|...yup. ...mmhmm.
Mayuri|Ok, I’ll tell him. Byebye♪
Rintaro|Well done, Mayuri. You’ll make a fine assistant yet. What did Faris want?
Mayuri|Well, she said that the Four Guardian Kings have assembled in Akiba, so be careful.
Rintaro|Don’t tell me that’s all she said?
Mayuri|Um, she also hasn’t found an IBN 5100 yet. She said if she does find one, she’ll contact you nyan.
Itaru|Guess that’s why they call it the phantom PC.
Itaru|I read on @channel that some collectors will pay millions of yen to buy one.
Itaru|IBN 5100s are serious business, man.
Rintaro|If they have that high a premium...
Itaru|I don’t get it. How come they’re so expensive?
Itaru|I mean, I guess they were pretty expensive to begin with. Looks like one cost about $20,000 back in the day.
Itaru|Anyway, I can’t believe it’s so hard to find one. Sure it was a nice machine for its time, but only for its time. You’d have to be crazy to want one now.
Itaru|Maybe it’s one guy buying them all up.
Itaru|Woah, what’s this?
Rintaro|What’s wrong?
Itaru|But... there’s no way that’s right!
Rintaro|What are you talking about? Explain.
Itaru|Well, I’m pulling data off the server, looking for a way to gain root access...
Itaru|And these files are downloading crazy fast. I mean, we’re talking light speed here.
Itaru|It’s hard to believe, but for some reason, this area has a direct fiber optic line to SERN. Several lines, even.
Rintaro|Direct? What do you mean?
Itaru|I mean there’s literally a fiber optic cable running from underneath this building to SERN’s headquarters in France.
Rintaro|Is that strange?
Itaru|Uh, yeah?
Itaru|Have a look. This is the route we used to visit the National Assembly of France’s site.
Itaru|It starts from our IP address. From there, it passes through various relays in Japan, jumps to France, then bounces around there for a while before finally reaching the National Assembly’s site. 
Itaru|It takes 16 steps total to get there.
Itaru|The average transfer rate is about 300 milliseconds. That’s normal for an overseas connection.
Itaru|In other words, there’s a route we have to take to get to France from Japan. Everyone takes the same route.
Itaru|Other countries are the same. Even browsing domestically takes about 10 steps.
Itaru|Now let’s try SERN.
Rintaro|There’s only one step...
Itaru|And the transfer rate is hundreds of times better than usual. Crazy fast! You can’t even get these numbers domestically, man.
Rintaro|Why do we have a direct line? Is this even possible?
Itaru|It was like this when we found it. I didn’t do anything.
Rintaro|So the building already had a hotline to SERN?
Rintaro|This can’t be a coincidence. It might just be the choice of Stei--
Itaru|It doesn’t make sense. Why would there be an independent line running from here all the way to SERN?
Itaru|No Japanese or French telecommunication company would set up something like this. Which means...
Rintaro|SERN did it themselves.
Itaru|But thanks to this direct line, we can now control the LHC remotely.
Rintaro|You figured out how!?
Mayuri|Wow! That’s amazing, Daru-kun.
Itaru|With a connection this fast, we can control the LHC practically in real-time. I haven’t actually tried it yet, though.
Mayuri|The LHC is that 20-kilometer-long tunnel thing, right? Um, what does it do again?
Rintaro|It accelerates protons and smashes them together.
Mayuri|Oh yeah. Mini black holes, right?
Itaru|The official line is that mini black holes might manifest as a byproduct of the particle collision, but that’s not the truth.
Rintaro|According to the top secret documents we found, the LHC was intended to create black holes from the very beginning.
Kurisu|Okabe.
Rintaro|What’s wrong?
Kurisu|I figured it out.
Kurisu|I think I know how the PhoneWave works.
Rintaro|Really!?
Kurisu|Keep in mind that this is just a hypothesis based on what we’ve observed.
Kurisu|It’s closely related to what you guys were just talking about -- the LHC.
Rintaro|I believe it was you, Christina, who called the LHC the world’s largest microwave. 
Kurisu|Yes. Exactly. My hunch was right.
Kurisu|You’ve created a monster, Okabe.
Kurisu|It doesn’t belong in some amateur lab. And before you take that as an endorsement of your abilities, I mean it in a bad way.
Rintaro|Give me details.
Kurisu|Did you know that the microwave oven was invented as a byproduct of radar research?
Kurisu|Microwaves are electromagnetic waves with a frequency of 2.45 gigahertz. The PhoneWave is commercial grade, so its output is around 1500-2000 watts.
Kurisu|Here’s the important part.
Rintaro|According to Daru’s blueprints, the microwave and the phone are made to send out shared electromagnetic waves by taking their leads...
Rintaro|And hardwiring each of them to the magnetron’s cathode and anode.
Kurisu|Both devices use electromagnetic waves. I’m not a specialist, though, so I can’t examine the extent or magnitude of the influence that fusion has...
Kurisu|But hypothetically, if the cellphone were to become a stepping stone, scattering the military-grade electromagnetic waves over a vast range of hundreds of kilometers--
Kurisu|Then not just Akihabara, but all of Tokyo would turn into the inside of a microwave oven.
Kurisu|Taking into account slight variance due to body weight, the average time until death for the people inside would be--
Kurisu|Three minutes.
Mayuri|Ehh!?
Itaru|Seriously? Then the PhoneWave’s a weapon of mass destruction, isn’t it!?
Kurisu|Let me tell you what happens inside the PhoneWave.
Kurisu|The air inside the oven is full of invisible hydrogen atoms. First, it bombards the atoms with microwaves to increase their energy potential. This is the normal function of a microwave oven.
Kurisu|But when you add the electromagnetic waves from the phone...
Kurisu|The harmonics trigger a chain reaction. The particles collide repeatedly at near light-speed, gaining mass and energy each time.
Kurisu|In other words, it becomes a sort of particle accelerator.
Rintaro|A particle accelerator!?
Rintaro|So, if the LHC was created to generate mini black holes--
Rintaro|Then the PhoneWave (name subject to change) must also produce mini black holes!
Kurisu|It’s a miracle that thing has been so stable. 
Kurisu|But there’s still one thing I don’t understand.
Kurisu|Even if it does produce mini black holes, they should evaporate instantly.
Kurisu|But that’s not what happens in the PhoneWave. The gelification phenomenon proves that.
Kurisu|Just like in the LHC, our mini black holes are turning into Kerr black holes.
Rintaro|According to Titor, you have to inject electrons to produce the Kerr black hole effect.
Kurisu|Where do the injected electrons come from? That’s what I don’t understand.
Kurisu|The LHC uses something called a lifter to inject electrons into the black hole and control the gravitational field.
Kurisu|Something is filling that role inside the PhoneWave.
Itaru|S-something?
Kurisu|Like I said, I don’t know what.
Rintaro|Looks like we need to review what the LHC is.
Itaru|LHC stands for Large Hadron Collider.
Mayuri|Had drawn?
Kurisu|It’s the name of an elementary particle.
Itaru|The LHC is basically a huge circular tunnel underneath Switzerland and France.
Itaru|It sits about 100 meters below ground, and has a total length of 27 kilometers.
Itaru|There are two rings that run through the tunnel. Inside the rings is a super-low-temperature vacuum -- an environment like outer space, basically. Seriously moe.
Itaru|In an adjacent facility, protons are gradually accelerated by the linear accelerator, the Proton Synchrotron Booster, and the Super Proton Synchrotron.
Itaru|Finally, they’re injected into the LHC, where they undergo their final acceleration via a series of superconducting magnets installed in the tunnel.
Itaru|By now, they’re traveling at up to 99.9999991% the speed of light. That’s enough to melt your brain. Not as dangerous as the PhoneWave, though.
Itaru|Finally, the accelerated protons collide approximately 1 to 10 billion times per second.
Itaru|The purpose of the LHC project is to study the high energy reactions that result... or so they say. We know they’re a bunch of stinking liars.
Rintaro|And that, my fellow lab members, brings us to the question. Can the PhoneWave (name subject to change) beat SERN to true physical time travel?
Kurisu|Two problems. One, setting the destination. Two, the lifter.
Rintaro|We’ve already established that the D-Mail arrives precisely when and where it’s supposed to.
Kurisu|...It’s dangerous to accept that without verification.
Rintaro|As for the lifter, we already know it exists. We just need to figure out what it is.
Kurisu|I don’t think we’re going to find it. The PhoneWave’s not exactly big, you know, and we’ve been poking at it for days without turning up a clue.
Kurisu|Even if we do find it, it’ll take forever to learn how to tune the electron feed properly.
Itaru|How long is forever?
Kurisu|SERN’s been working on it for nine years and they still haven’t solved it.
Rintaro|Let’s look at it from a different angle.
Rintaro|SERN tried to send people back in time, but they couldn’t get the electron feed right. The singularities were not naked.
Rintaro|It’s the same with the PhoneWave (name subject to change). You can only send 36 bytes of data safely. Otherwise, you get a Jellyman.
Rintaro|Let’s consider the problem in reverse.
Rintaro|What if we could convert a human to data, then compress that data into just 36 bytes?
Rintaro|We could send that person through the ring singularity just like a D-Mail, couldn’t we!?
Itaru|Convert a human to data? That’s not even possible, man.
Itaru|And even if it were, there’d be like exabytes of data or something! You want to compress that into 36 bytes? Are you high?
Rintaro|Hmm... I thought it was a good idea...
Kurisu|Of course... If it works, then maybe...
Kurisu|Maybe we can do it!
Rintaro|Are you serious?
Kurisu|The data compression part, at least, is easy.
Kurisu|We can just use the black holes created by the LHC, since black holes compress everything they swallow.
Kurisu|Compression won’t harm data like it would harm a human. As long as we’re just sending data, there’s nothing to worry about.
Rintaro|How do you plan to convert humans into data?
Kurisu|You know that my thesis got published, right?
Rintaro|This is no time to flaunt your accomplishments.
Kurisu|Have you read it?
Itaru|I’ve got scans if you want to read it.
Kurisu|The title of my thesis is...
Kurisu|’Analysis of Memory-Related Nerve Impulses in the Temporal Lobe’
Rintaro|...Temporal lobe? Nerve impulses?
Itaru|What, you didn’t know?
Rintaro|No, wait. This can’t be right. This title sounds like, um, neuroscience, not physics.
Kurisu|I’m a neuroscientist. Got a problem?
Rintaro|No, forget about that. How is this related to time travel?
Kurisu|Converting an entire human to data is impossible.
Kurisu|But converting a human’s memories may be possible!
Kurisu|Imagine a chest of drawers. Each drawer is filled with tiny boxes, and inside each box is another bunch of tiny boxes. You keep opening boxes until you find the memory you’re looking for.
Kurisu|Now, before you ask how this relates to time travel, there’s one more thing I need to explain.
Kurisu|Several years ago, my lab -- the Neurophysiology Lab at Victor Condoria University -- developed a technology called Visual Rebuilding, or VR for short.
Kurisu|Put simply, it enables conversion of video data into nerve impulse signals. 
Kurisu|Used in reverse, it can also convert nerve impulses into video data, or any other kind of electronic data.
Kurisu|So, if we combine VR technology with my research... do you see where I’m going?
Itaru|...No way.
Rintaro|We can convert memories into data?
Kurisu|Not just that. Memory transplantation, backups, external storage... all of those things become possible.
Rintaro|So basically, what you’re saying is that we convert the subject’s memories into video data...
Rintaro|Use the LHC’s black hole to compress that data into 36 bytes...
Rintaro|Send that data through the Kerr black hole inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change)...
Rintaro|And finally, imprint those memories on the subject’s brain in the past.
Mayuri|What does that mean?
Kurisu|We can send our memories back in time.
Kurisu|In order to differentiate it from physical time travel, let’s call it a ’time leap’ for now.
Kurisu|You don’t go back, just your memories.
Kurisu|It’s so crazy that nobody’s thought of it before.
Kurisu|The important thing to remember is that only memories are being transferred.
Kurisu|Personality and consciousness aren’t included.
Rintaro|What does that mean? How is it different from what you see in sci-fi novels?
Kurisu|Time leaping in sci-fi usually sends everything -- consciousness, personality, and memory.
Kurisu|But in real life, there’s probably too much data, and besides, we only analyzed memories.
Kurisu|Think of consciousness, personality, and memory as separate things.
Kurisu|Memories are like the video data stored on your computer.
Kurisu|And consciousness and personality are like the OS.
Itaru|But videos can take up way more space than the OS.
Kurisu|It’s just an example.
Kurisu|For starters, it’s still not clear where personality and consciousness are located, or how they are constructed.
Kurisu|So we can’t convert them into data. Or at least, I can’t.
Rintaro|So we can only send memories. Where does that leave us?
Kurisu|Your memories aren’t the only thing that define you. Even if you send your memories to the past, it will be the receiving you’s consciousness and personality that process them.
Itaru|So in Mindorz terms, it’s like copying data from a VISTA computer to a Min95 computer?
Kurisu|Data created with the latest OS might not work on an older OS. It might cause errors.
Kurisu|For example, if you sent your current memories to yourself in elementary school, the gap between your memories and your body could have serious consequences.
Rintaro|Anyway, is it correct to assume that we’ll be targeting ourselves in the past?
Kurisu|Just like with D-Mail, we’re using cellphones as the transfer medium.
Kurisu|To be precise, you can only leap into your own body, and only if you had a cellphone at the time of reception.
Kurisu|If you try sending memories to someone else... umm, how do I put this... there’s a danger that the electrical signals might be rejected.
Itaru|Wouldn’t want to jump into someone else’s body. I mean, unless it’s the body of a cute girl. Uhehe!
Kurisu|Don’t ’uhehe’ me, you idiot!
Kurisu|If it just bounces off, that’s fine, but I’m worried incompatible memory data might do serious damage to the recipient’s psyche.
Kurisu|I don’t know what might happen. No one’s done it before, after all.
Kurisu|There are two things I do know. One, you definitely cannot go back before you were born; and two, you won’t exist in two places at once.
Kurisu|That means you don’t have to worry about causing a paradox. You can’t kill your parents before you were born.
Rintaro|So the phones act like black and white holes...
Rintaro|Heh... heh heh heh... MUHAHAHA!
Rintaro|It’s me. Everything is falling into place. The plan can now proceed to the final stage. I’m talking about Operation Verthandi, obviously.
Rintaro|Heh. Christina had me fooled. I never knew she was capable of this. It must have been the choice of Steins Gate that sent her here.
Rintaro|Don’t worry. I have everything under control. Nothing can stop us now. El Psy Kongroo.
Rintaro|Were you listening? Good. Commence preparations for Operation Verthandi!
Kurisu|First, explain what that is!
Rintaro|We’re going to build your time leap machine, Christina. And you’d better not say it can’t be done! Not after showing me the way!
Kurisu|Well, this is Akihabara. I should be able to find the parts I need.
Rintaro|Then it’s decided. I’m placing you in charge of this operation. Whatever you need, ask, and it shall be yours.
Rintaro|Together, we shall complete the first time leap machine in human history!
Rintaro|What are you doing?
Kurisu|Thinking about the time leap machine.
Kurisu|I know we can make it, but I’m wondering what will happen if we actually use it.
Rintaro|Ah.
Rintaro|You’re thinking too hard. Finish the machine, then worry about it.
Kurisu|You’re so pompous.
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|Hey, Okabe...
Kurisu|Can I talk to you about something completely unrelated?
Rintaro|I’d rather talk about something related.
Kurisu|You told me before that I could ask you anything. Remember?
Kurisu|I think... my father hates me.
Rintaro|Very well. Speak!
Kurisu|Heh... you really are pompous.
Rintaro|I assume it was your father on the phone the other day?
Kurisu|...Yeah.
Kurisu|I don’t remember the last time he had a kind word for me.
Kurisu|Even when we were living together, before I went to America, he acted like I wasn’t there. We’re supposed to be family, aren’t we?
Rintaro|And you? How did you treat your father?
Kurisu|I was daddy’s little girl growing up. You practically had to drag me away from him.
Kurisu|My father’s a physicist. Even as a child, I loved to hear him talk about science. I couldn’t understand a word of it, but I always begged him to explain.
Kurisu|I wanted to understand his work, so I started studying physics. I must have been five.
Kurisu|Thanks to that, I always got perfect grades in math. I ignored all the other subjects, though, so my grades were a little skewed.
Kurisu|I even read my father’s papers. I was a little girl trying to comprehend theoretical physics, but I gave it everything I had. I needed to understand.
Kurisu|By sixth grade, I had learned enough that I could discuss my father’s theories with him.
Kurisu|I was so happy that I could talk to my father on his level, you know? We used to argue all night long.
Kurisu|And then I started winning those arguments. All of them.
Rintaro|Yeah. I can definitely see how that would make him hate you.
Kurisu|You really think that’s why?
Rintaro|I’m absolutely certain that’s why.
Kurisu|I guess he did have a lot of pride.
Kurisu|Anyway, one day, he suddenly stopped talking to me altogether.
Kurisu|Then he started fighting with my mom, and finally he stopped coming home.
Kurisu|I really loved my dad, so it was a big shock. I felt it was my fault things turned out that way. I couldn’t go to school, I was so depressed.
Kurisu|And then Mom recommended I study abroad.
Rintaro|You were just too talented for your own good.
Rintaro|So, how do you feel about your father now?
Kurisu|I don’t know...
Rintaro|He’s in Japan, right? Have you seen him at all?
Kurisu|No... he doesn’t want to see me.
Kurisu|That’s what we were talking about on the phone. I asked if we could meet, but he told me to stay away from him.
Kurisu|Even if we did meet, I wouldn’t know what to say...
Kurisu|I tried to talk to him before I left, you know? I tried so hard, but he just ignored me.
Kurisu|It hurts. Whenever I think about going to see him, I remember those times. I worry he’ll ignore me again, and then I can’t do anything.
Kurisu|Sniff...
Rintaro|Are you crying?
Kurisu|J-just a little, okay?
Rintaro|You want to reconcile with your father. Correct?
Kurisu|I don’t know...
Rintaro|If you didn’t, then you wouldn’t have confided in me. And you wouldn’t be crying, would you?
Kurisu|True...
Rintaro|Just be straight with him. Say ’I love you, Dad. Let’s make up.’
Kurisu|I think that’s a little out of character for me.
Rintaro|It’s your father. Stop acting like a weak little girl.
Kurisu|I’m not acting like a little girl!
Rintaro|Yes, you are. You’ll never reconcile with him like that.
Rintaro|You need to speak from the heart, give it to him straight.
Rintaro|It’s the only way to get your message across. You can’t sugarcoat it.
Rintaro|If that doesn’t work, nothing will. Then you’ll just have to hope that time heals the rift between you.
Kurisu|And how long will that take?
Rintaro|How should I know? I’m only a year older than you, remember?
Rintaro|How long has it been since you went to America?
Kurisu|Umm... seven years.
Rintaro|If nothing has changed in seven years, then maybe it will take twice that much time.
Kurisu|I... guess you’re right.
Rintaro|Well? When are you going to see him?
Kurisu|...Huh?
Rintaro|I assume it’ll be during summer break. Make sure you let me know ahead of time.
Kurisu|Wha-wha-wha-what are you talking about!?
Rintaro|I might have plans. I’ll need to shift my schedule around.
Kurisu|Hold on a second! Don’t tell me you plan on coming along!?
Rintaro|Of course I do. You are my assistant, and I will do whatever it takes to ensure that you are in peak mental condition for the experiment.
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|Ok, you’ve had your fun. I’m in no mood for--
Rintaro|I’m being completely serious.
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|I’ll go anywhere you want -- anywhere in Japan. I’d go anywhere in the world, but I don’t have a passport or money.
Kurisu|Okabe...
Rintaro|You’re afraid you won’t know what to say, right?
Kurisu|Yeah...
Rintaro|Then that settles it. I am a master of conversation. You will have nothing to fear with Hououin Kyouma at your side!
Kurisu|...pfft!
Rintaro|Why are you laughing!?
Kurisu|You couldn’t hold a normal conversation if your life depended on it.
Rintaro|Ah...
Kurisu|But... thanks anyway. I definitely didn’t expect you to offer to come...
Kurisu|N-not that I’m happy about it or anything!
Kurisu|I hate how you act like a nice guy sometimes! It’s confusing!
Kurisu|Um, Okabe? That offer... I can take you up on it, right?
Rintaro|Of course.
Kurisu|Then, once we’re done upgrading the PhoneWave...
Kurisu|I want you to come with me.
Rintaro|As you wish. Where is your father, anyway?
Kurisu|Aomori.
Rintaro|Aomori!?
Kurisu|That’s where he lives now.
Kurisu|What? You’re not going to back out, are you? You already promised. I’m taking you whether you like it or not, okay!?
Rintaro|...A-Aomori it is!
Rintaro|Mayuri? You’re not going home?
Mayuri|Um, I was thinking about what Okarin and Chris-chan were talking about earlier.
Mayuri|I was trying to figure out what the things you said meant, but it was all so complicated. I didn’t get any of it. Ehehe...
Mayuri|The only thing I get is that something amazing is gonna happen!
Rintaro|Indeed. The world is about to change, and we shall be the ones to lead humanity into the future.
Mayuri|You’re shining, Okarin.
Rintaro|Shining? What does that mean?
Mayuri|You’re shining. Chris-chan too. Like two bright stars in the sky.
Rintaro|That must be my aura of madness you’re sensing. Muhahaha!
Mayuri|You know, it’s been ten days since Chris-chan joined us. Can I tell you how I’ve been feeling?
Mayuri|Since Chris-chan became a lab mem, it feels like things have really started to happen, like we’re a real lab now, you know?
Rintaro|Heh. I must admit, her knowledge has been a great asset.
Rintaro|Of course, the girl genius would never have joined us if not for the cunning of Hououin Kyouma!
Mayuri|That’s why you’re shining so bright now, Okarin.
Mayuri|Chris-chan is really a big help to you, I know...
Mayuri|But I can’t do anything to help...
Mayuri|I wish I were smart too... then maybe I could help.
Rintaro|Mayuri...
Rintaro|Mayuri. Aren’t you going to look at the stars?
Mayuri|Back when the lab just started -- before Daru-kun joined -- it was like this a lot, wasn’t it? All quiet, just the two of us.
Rintaro|Yeah, it was.
Mayuri|Can Mayushii stay here? Is it really okay?
Rintaro|Don’t be ridiculous.
Rintaro|All you need to do is stay.
Mayuri|Just... stay?
Rintaro|Without you, the lab would be a much less friendly place.
Rintaro|You see how Kurisu and I argue. We can be pretty stubborn, and sometimes we don’t know when to stop.
Rintaro|But when it starts to get out of hand, Mayuri, you’re always there with some ditzy, irrelevant comment to break the tension.
Mayuri|Um... are you praising me?
Rintaro|Of course I am.
Rintaro|Don’t worry about a thing. Just know that you, too, are part of my plan. Muhahaha!
Mayuri|Okay. Thanks, Okarin♪
Mayuri|I’m starving! I’ll warm up some canned oden. You want some too?
Rintaro|Yeah. Heat it up.
Mayuri|Coming right up!
Rintaro|I’m begging you, stick with me. If you get lost in this labyrinth of technology, you’ll never escape. Not with your sense of direction.
Mayuri|Okey-dokey! I’ll be careful.
Mayuri|Um, by the way. How is time leaping different from time travel?
Rintaro|Time travel means your whole body travels through time. The time leap will only send your memories to the past. It’s simple.
Mayuri|Oh...
Mayuri|Does that mean you can do things with time leaps that you can’t do with D-Mails?
Rintaro|D-Mails can only send instructions to the past. The past may change, or it may not. The results are unpredictable, and depend on the recipient.
Rintaro|And when the past does change, the worldline is reconfigured. Everyone loses their old memories.
Rintaro|With a time leap, on the other hand, you can give your past self not just instructions, but all of the memories you have right now... or at least, that’s the idea.
Mayuri|Ummm, so I could send the costume I’m making back to last week? I would love to have another week to prepare for ComiMa.
Rintaro|That might be possible with time travel, but not with time leaping.
Rintaro|Say you had a test last week. Now that you know the answers, you could send that knowledge to yourself and ace the test. But you couldn’t go back and hand yourself a cheat sheet.
Mayuri|So Mayushii’s mind goes into Mayushii one week ago?
Rintaro|Exactly.
Mayuri|You can’t bring stuff, but you can bring your memories... I get it.
Mayuri|But, then what about Mayushii one week ago? Where do her memories go?
Rintaro|I assume they get overwritten.
Mayuri|She disappears?
Rintaro|Your memories right now include your memories from back then. So even if she does disappear, you don’t really lose anything.
Rintaro|I guess you could say you’re just adding your memories from one week in the future.
Mayuri|Then, if Mayushii’s memories leap into the Mayushii one week ago, what happens to Mayushii now?
Mayuri|Mayushii’s memories jump to the past, but my body’s still here, right? What happens to me when my memories go bye-bye?
Rintaro|You become an empty shell... no... that can’t be right. That wouldn’t make sense.
Rintaro|My assistant’s device merely records your memory data... in other words, it’s just a backup. Your original memories are still inside you.
Rintaro|Your body shouldn’t become an empty shell, and your consciousness shouldn’t leap, either.
Rintaro|Actually, won’t you become a new Mayuri, one who received memories from the future one week ago?
Mayuri|Then, does the Mayushii who had the normal memories before the time leap get erased by the Mayushii who repeated the week with extra memories?
Rintaro|That’s right. She’s erased. In other words, you relive the week. You can do things the same, or you could do something completely different.
Rintaro|And you’ll keep your old memories of the week that disappeared.
Mayuri|Then, does that mean...
Mayuri|So I redo the week, okay... but what if I decide to go to Ikebukuro with my friends instead of coming to the lab today?
Mayuri|What happens to the Mayushii talking with Okarin now?
Rintaro|The present would change to match the past, and this conversation would never happen.
Mayuri|Oh... and you wouldn’t notice the difference, Okarin?
Rintaro|Right. No one would notice.
Mayuri|That would be kinda sad...
Rintaro|For who? Me?
Mayuri|No. For Mayushii.
Mayuri|Maybe that’s why Chris-chan doesn’t want to change the past.
Mayuri|Oh! I just thought of something. Can you time leap into the future?
Rintaro|Maybe, but there wouldn’t be a point.
Rintaro|The whole point of our time leap machine is to affect past events. We don’t need to worry about the future.
Rintaro|Besides, you’re less likely to reach the future than you are the past.
Rintaro|And that’s because the future is inherently unpredictable.
Rintaro|For example, do you think you’ll have the same phone number for all eternity?
Mayuri|How should I know? Ehehe.
Rintaro|Exactly my point.
Rintaro|And remember, pagers became obsolete with the advent of cellphones. Similarly, our phones may be replaced by some other device in the future.
Mayuri|Oh... I guess I can’t go back to grade school, can I? I didn’t have a phone back then.
Rintaro|You want to go back to your elementary school days?
Rintaro|Heh heh heh, I know exactly how you feel. If you repeat elementary school with the knowledge you have now, you’ll get top grades and have an easy time bending children to your will.
Mayuri|Yeah, and I thought maybe I could see Grandma again.
Rintaro|...I see. I’m afraid that’s not possible.
Mayuri|Yeah... It’s too bad, but I guess I don’t really need to see her.
Mayuri|I still remember her words, her smile, and her wrinkly hand patting my head.
Mayuri|So even if I don’t see her again, I’m okay.
Mayuri|What I really want is to see little Okarin again! Ehehe!
Rintaro|Heh. Back then, I was already a scientist without equal, a titan towering above the other children.
Rintaro|You can hardly be blamed for desiring to meet the child prodigy who would one day be feared as the great mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma.
Mayuri|I don’t want to meet Hououin Whatshisface. I want to meet Okarin!
Rintaro|Anyway, there’s no point. You haven’t matured at all since that time, so nothing would change if you went back to elementary school anyway.
Mayuri|Hey! That’s not true. Mayushii’s all grown up now.
Rintaro|The only thing that’s grown is how much you eat.
Mayuri|That’s not true! Mayushii’s a real woman now.
Mayuri|Besides, I think Okarin’s the one who hasn’t changed since then.
Rintaro|Isn’t that what I said? I was already a genius mad scientist when you met me! MUHAHAHA!
Rintaro|By the way, Mayuri. Have you not been working recently?
Mayuri|Working? You mean at Lemoine?
Mayuri|Um, ComiMa’s coming up, so I’m taking a few days off.
Mayuri|I’ve got costumes to make!
Rintaro|How many costumes are you making this year?
Mayuri|Three. One for Kaede-chan, one for Fubuki-chan, and then there’s one for Luka-chan.
Mayuri|Ah... it’s Moeka-san.
Rintaro|What?
Rintaro|Hey, Finger! Why the long face, eh?
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Moeka-san. What are you doing here?
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Hey, are you listening? If you have a problem, the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, will gladly assist!
Rintaro|But be warned. By the time I’m through, Akiba will be an ocean of blood... heh heh heh.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|What is it? What’s wrong?
Moeka|...
Rintaro|What do you mean, what happened?
Moeka|...
Rintaro|We don’t fully understand it yet. We’re in the middle of upgrading it.
Mayuri|It’s amazing! This time, we might even be able to time leap.
Rintaro|Don’t write anything about it. Otherwise we’ll have to expel you from the lab.
Rintaro|Our hacking of SERN has uncovered a new possibility for the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Rintaro|It’s a form of time travel made possible by borrowing SERN’s equipment.
Rintaro|This discovery will begin a new age of human civilization. No longer will men be slaves to time. Any future you desire can be yours!
Rintaro|And history will record that we, the Future Gadget Laboratory, changed the world forever!
Mayuri|Um, Okarin, that was really confusing. You lost Mayushii.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|U-unhand me!
Rintaro|The time leap is a way to send your memories to the past!
Rintaro|We found a way to make that possible. Soon we will complete the machine and become the undisputed lords of time!
Mayuri|Um, Okarin came up with the idea and Chris-chan told us how to do it. Daru-kun’s helping, and Mayushii and Okarin are shopping♪
Moeka|...
Mayuri|Are you okay, Moeka-san? Do you feel sick?
Moeka|...
Rintaro|I can’t be sure. There are still several problems remaining. If they don’t give us too much trouble, I guess we’ll have it done in a week.
Rintaro|On the other hand, we can’t do anything until they’re solved.
Rintaro|Everything is the choice of Steins Gate. I have faith there exists a path to success.
Rintaro|And once the door is opened, the chaos for which I have so longed shall at last descend upon the Earth. Trumpets will sound from the highest heaven, and the final battle, Ragnarok, will begin!
Mayuri|Who are you fighting, Okarin?
Rintaro|The Organization, of course. Their rule must end once and for all.
Mayuri|Wow! Don’t do anything dangerous, okay?
Moeka|Hehe...
Moeka|Hehehe...
Mayuri|What do you think is wrong with Moeka-san?
Rintaro|Muha, muhahaha, MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Mayuri|Whaaah? Now Okarin’s acting weird!
Mayuri|Mayushii’s worried...
Kurisu|Ah...
Kurisu|H-hey! Think you could knock!?
Rintaro|This isn’t your room. Besides, I’d have to be a fool to knock. There could be assassins lying in ambush.
Kurisu|Assassins? Here? Are you stupid?
Rintaro|Anyway, Christina. What were you looking at just now, hmm?
Kurisu|I was... doing research!
Kurisu|S-stay back!
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|G-got a problem?
Rintaro|...pfft!
Kurisu|Hey! What’s with that ’this is awful, rofl rofl’ laughter!?
Rintaro|Have no fear, Christina. Or should I call you... @channeler Chris!
Kurisu|Don’t call me that!
Rintaro|Heh heh heh, I already knew. That’s right! I realized long ago that you were an @channeler!
Rintaro|You can’t hide it from me. You reek of @channel corruption!
Kurisu|How rude! I make sure to apply light perfume every day!
Rintaro|Fool. That’s not what I meant. I’m talking about the scent of your soul.
Kurisu|My soul? What’s that supposed to mean? Explain.
Rintaro|Why? So you can learn how to hide it?
Kurisu|Sh-shut up! Just explain already.
Rintaro|There’s nothing to explain. You use @channel memes in conversation. I’d have to be stupid not to notice.
Kurisu|...Feels bad, man.
Rintaro|That’s an @channel meme too.
Kurisu|Ugh...
Rintaro|Your soul is tainted with the essence of @channel. You cannot hide it, not in such close proximity to another who uses @channel memes in actual conversation. Your souls resonate.
Kurisu|That’s it! It’s all Hashida’s fault!
Rintaro|But it’s cute how you try to hide it, @channeler Chris.
Kurisu|DON’T CALL ME THAT.
Rintaro|But I don’t understand. You were raised in America, so how are you so familiar with @channel?
Kurisu|You can browse @channel from America. Need I say more?
Rintaro|Ahh, I get it. Living in an English-only environment made you hungry for Japanese. But did you have to resort to @channel?
Kurisu|Sure, it’s not the friendliest place, but I couldn’t find anywhere that felt more ’Japanese’.
Kurisu|Anyway, can I ask a favor?
Rintaro|What is it?
Rintaro|If you have something to say, say it.
Kurisu|Don’t tell anyone else about this.
Rintaro|What difference does it make? Daru’s the most hardcore @channeler who ever lived, and Mayuri’s an otaku too. Even I browse @channel regularly.
Rintaro|There’s nothing to be ashamed of! Just boldly write ’Hobbies: Browsing @channel’ on your resume!
Kurisu|Not a chance, you idiot!
Rintaro|What!? You mean you’d rather post anchors on VIP!?
Kurisu|Gh, I hate myself for understanding those words!
Rintaro|Well, whatever. If it will help you focus on the time leap machine, I’ll keep your secret for now. Besides, it’s just a matter of time before you make another mistake and reveal your true colors.
Kurisu|You don’t have to worry about me. Remember that I represented my entire laboratory when we presented our research, even though there were men twice my age on the project.
Kurisu|I’m an expert at dealing with people. I’ll have no trouble keeping it a secret.
Rintaro|...Nullpo.
Kurisu|Gah!
Kurisu|No...!
Mayuri|*yawn*...
Rintaro|Mayuri, go home before it gets too late. Your parents will worry.
Mayuri|It’s okay. I’m gonna stay the night.
Rintaro|...R-really?
Mayuri|Yup. I already told Mom and Dad.
Rintaro|Are you staying to work on your costume?
Mayuri|It won’t be done in time for ComiMa if I don’t. Ehehe!
Rintaro|I’m surprised your parents let you stay.
Rintaro|It must be my overwhelming charisma... No, wait, that makes me sound like a good person, so that can’t be it...
Rintaro|Of course! Mayuri’s parents are so afraid of my insanity that they sent me their only daughter as a hostage!
Kurisu|Reported.
Kurisu|What would you do if I called the cops on you?
Rintaro|I unleash my right arm on traitors, Christina.
Kurisu|Yeah, yeah, chuunibyou, whatever.
Mayuri|Um, I told Mom and Dad that Chris-chan would be here. Then they said okay.
Kurisu|Wait, so I have to stay too?
Mayuri|Yup♪ Don’t you have to work on the PhoneWave?
Kurisu|I guess... but I don’t relish the thought of spending the night here. At least, not with a certain somebody around.
Rintaro|Environment matters, Christina. This is a place of science and research, so you should have no trouble concentrating on your work. Trust the great Hououin Kyouma.
Rintaro|Also, it may surprise you to learn that I have equipped this lab with a system that stimulates brain function.
Rintaro|So if you were wondering where my incredible genius comes from, now you know! It’s because I sleep in this room every night!
Kurisu|This stimulation system of yours... I assume it’s been dumping toxic waste in your brain?
Rintaro|You sound like an environmentalist, Zombie.
Mayuri|Ah, Mayushii knows! You’re talking about that, right?
Kurisu|This... air freshener?
Mayuri|Okarin said the smell makes you smarter. He bought it at Akiba-o. When was that?
Rintaro|...About six months ago. It was on sale for 500 yen.
Kurisu|I’m starting to think even you don’t believe the stuff you say.
Kurisu|And besides, this air freshener is empty.
Kurisu|Well, whatever. I was planning to stay either way. I’ll join you, Mayuri-san.
Mayuri|Really? That’s great!
Kurisu|On one condition. Okabe leaves.
Rintaro|Me, leave? I practically live here! This lab was promised to me by Steins Gate. It’s the dwelling place of my soul!
Kurisu|We girls are staying here overnight, so you filthy boys need to show respect. Your home isn’t even far from here, right?
Mayuri|Okarin lives close to Mayushii, in Ikebukuro.
Kurisu|Why, that’s less than 30 minutes by train. Anyway, I’m not going to need your help tonight, so just go home like a good boy, okay?
Rintaro|But I refuse.
Kurisu|What? Are you planning to molest us!?
Rintaro|Shut up, Mongolian Spot!
Kurisu|I don’t have a Mongolian Spot! And when did you see my butt, anyway!?
Rintaro|I can’t leave two young girls here alone! Minors need guardians!
Mayuri|But Okarin’s a minor too!
Rintaro|I’ll be 20 in less than a year and a half. In other words, Steins Gate has decided that I am an adult.
Kurisu|I’m pretty sure that makes you a minor just like us.
Mayuri|Um, Chris-chan? I don’t think Okarin would do anything bad.
Mayuri|I mean, we’ve been together for more than ten years, and he hasn’t molested me once.
Kurisu|But he took you hostage, didn’t he?
Mayuri|Yup♪ Actually, I’m still his hostage.
Kurisu|We should kick him out of the room.
Rintaro|Haa...
Rintaro|You disappoint me, Christina.
Rintaro|This lab is a place of science. We are above such petty concerns as sex. If you must speak of these vulgarities, then I’ll have to ask you and your Mongolian Spot to leave!
Rintaro|Ah. So Christina really does have a birthmark on her bu--
Kurisu|NO!
Rintaro|Is everyone okay!?
Kurisu|Kyaaa! What are you doing!?
Mayuri|Hyah! No peeking, Okarin!
Rintaro|Phew. You’re still alive.
Rintaro|Don’t scare me like that. What are you guys doing packed into that tiny shower anyway?
Kurisu|Get out, you perv!
Rintaro|Whoa!
Mayuri|Mayushii’s sad... I feel kinda dirty....
Kurisu|You’re gonna regret this! I’ll never forgive you!
Rintaro|It’s me. We have a problem. I’m under attack from the Mongolian Spot and Ditzy sisters. They’re going directly after my sanity, a bold move against the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma.
Rintaro|This is the strongest offensive I’ve encountered so far. I realize now that vulnerability itself can be a powerful weapon. They’re pulling out all the stops, and I don’t think my pants can take it.
Rintaro|Give in to the temptation? Nonsense. I could never do that. They’re fellow lab members, my loyal assistant and my childhood friend.
Rintaro|...Must I? Is it truly the will of Steins Gate that I give in? That I raise my hand against my closest companions? If so... then how cruel the fates be!
Rintaro|El... Psy... Kongroo!
Kurisu|For the final adjustments, we need to use the PhoneWave.
Itaru|It’s up to you, Okarin.
Kurisu|Take care of it.
Rintaro|In other words, you’re sending me to die.
Kurisu|Your sacrifice will allow us to complete the time leap machine.
Itaru|Besides, you’re always the one who talks to the boss for us.
Rintaro|Well maybe it’s time for you to put your lives on the line.
Kurisu|I can’t. That girl who works there hates me.
Rintaro|...Fine. But hear this. I will not die! Like the immortal phoenix, I will return, no matter how many times it takes!
Mayuri|Don’t die. Okay?
Suzuha|’Sup, Okabe Rintaro.
Rintaro|I see you’re as busy as ever.
Tennouji|Okabe! Buy a CRT.
Rintaro|No thanks. I’m not some kind of retro TV otaku. I’d rather buy an LCD.
Tennouji|You’ve been having a lotta girls over lately, haven’t ya?
Rintaro|Just the usual members.
Suzuha|I was over the other day.
Tennouji|Invite me next time, huh? I wanna talk to some young girls for a change.
Nae|Daddy, that’s dirty.
Tennouji|N-no it isn’t! It’s, uh... marketing! Yeah, I’m looking for new customers!
Suzuha|What do you mean, for a change? You talk to me every day.
Rintaro|You’re not young.
Suzuha|Did you say something, Okabe Rintaro?
Rintaro|Only the truth.
Tennouji|Nae, your father is happy as long as he has you. Okay?
Nae|Yup. I know. But don’t say dirty things anymore, ’kay?
Tennouji|It’s a promise!
Suzuha|Hey, did Shiina Mayuri stay over yesterday?
Rintaro|Yeah.
Suzuha|So... Makise Kurisu stayed too?
Rintaro|Yeah. They’re both upstairs.
Suzuha|Oh...
Rintaro|And how are you doing?
Suzuha|Huh?
Rintaro|Are you feeling better?
Suzuha|Oh. Yeah, I guess. The search continues.
Tennouji|Huh? What’s this about, part-timer?
Suzuha|I’m searching for my dad. I told you before, remember?
Tennouji|Oh, right. Go find her old man, Okabe.
Rintaro|Hmph, naturally. Suzuha’s a fellow lab member. Leave it to us.
Suzuha|Okabe Rintaro... we’re the same age, but sometimes you seem a lot older. You really know how to give people strength.
Rintaro|Heh, of course. I am the great Hououin Kyouma!
Nae|...
Tennouji|Okabe. Next time you scare Nae, I’ll kill ya.
Rintaro|S-sorry...
Suzuha|Come here a sec.
Suzuha|I just want to say...
Suzuha|Be circumspect in your dealings with Makise Kurisu.
Rintaro|What?
Rintaro|This again? Aren’t you just being paranoid?
Suzuha|No. Her perniciousness has been proven.
Suzuha|Her genius is a threat. At heart, she only cares about her experiments.
Suzuha|Listen to me. She’s using you all.
Suzuha|Makise Kurisu is connected to SERN.
Rintaro|What!?
Rintaro|You’re saying she’s a spy?
Suzuha|The credit for inventing the time machine was hers.
Suzuha|Don’t let your guard down.
Nae|Kyah...
Rintaro|Damn, it’s too soon!
Tennouji|OKABE!
Tennouji|How many times do I have tell you not to shake the building!? Cute girls or no, I ain’t letting you off. Your rent’s going up!
Rintaro|Wait, Mister Braun! This isn’t our doing! It’s an earthquake! My magic eye, Reading Steiner, predicted this would happen!
Tennouji|An earthquake!? You think I’ll fall for that!?
Tennouji|Braun tube-chan, no!!
Tennouji|Okabe, you bastard!
Rintaro|...
Tennouji|...
Nae|Hauww...
Suzuha|Is it over?
Tennouji|Looks like it.
Rintaro|Heh... heh heh heh.
Nae|...!
Suzuha|...What’s wrong?
Rintaro|Muhaha. Muhahahaha! MUHAHAHAHAHA!
Rintaro|I’ve done it! I’VE DONE IT! This is the lifter!
Rintaro|It’s so obvious! Why didn’t I see it before!?
Rintaro|Of course... this must be the work of Steins Gate! It chose this moment for a reason!
Tennouji|What are the hell are you laughing about, Okabe? You’re scaring my daughter! I’m raising your rent, you hear!? And you’re paying for that CRT!
Rintaro|A little silence please, Mister Braun! This is a most glorious moment, for I have just been chosen as the ruler of all space and time! MUHAHAHAHAHA!
Rintaro|Guh!
Rintaro|You... dare lay hands on the great...
Tennouji|Got somethin’ to say?
Rintaro|Heh... heh heh... well then, Mister Braun... put it on my tab!
Rintaro|All’s well that ends well! Muhahaha!
Mayuri|Okarin! The building just shook. Are you okay?
Kurisu|Looks like you really are unkillable.
Rintaro|Heh heh heh. I have seen the future, Christina. In three minutes, you will be on your knees praising my greatness!
Kurisu|I don’t think so.
Kurisu|How could you miss something so obvious?
Rintaro|Why are you blaming me?
Kurisu|...I’m not blaming you. I’m just disappointed that nobody, including myself, noticed.
Itaru|We missed the forest for the trees.
Rintaro|To summarize...
Rintaro|Just now, when the PhoneWave (name subject to change) shook the building, the 42-inch CRT was on.
Rintaro|But when Mister Braun turned the TV off, the shaking stopped immediately.
Kurisu|The discharge was interrupted.
Kurisu|I put a banana in just to be sure. Nothing happened.
Mayuri|I’m glad. We shouldn’t waste food.
Kurisu|We’ve found the answer.
Kurisu|The electrons emitted by the 42-inch CRT are holding the PhoneWave’s black hole open.
Kurisu|And the discharge phenomenon is the result.
Itaru|So the reason we can’t use the PhoneWave at night is because the Braun Tube Workshop’s closed?
Rintaro|But how can a cathode ray tube emit such a strong electron stream?
Kurisu|It’s not about having a strong electron stream. If stronger were better, SERN would’ve solved the lifter problem long ago.
Kurisu|Somehow, the conditions here were perfect to create a time machine. Frankly, it’s a miracle.
Rintaro|No, Christina! Not a miracle!
Rintaro|This is the choice of Steins Gate!
Kurisu|Whatever it is, it worked.
Mayuri|Umm...
Mayuri|So, um, what do we have to do to complete Super PhoneWave-chan?
Kurisu|Now that we’ve found the cause, there’s nothing left to hold us back.
Kurisu|We can safely conclude that time leaping is possible when, and only when, that television is on.
Itaru|We should probably test it, right? And there’s still the final check of the PhoneWave to do.
Kurisu|You’re right. Okabe.
Rintaro|What?
Kurisu|Go downstairs and turn that TV back on.
Rintaro|Ha. Ha. Ha. That’s hilarious, Christina. Allow me to dub that...
Rintaro|Mission: Impossible!
Kurisu|Whatever. Just go already.
Kurisu|If anyone can do it, it’s you. You made an amazing discovery just now, didn’t you?
Rintaro|Assistant mine... have you finally recognized my greatness as a mad scientist?
Kurisu|No.
Rintaro|Ah.
Itaru|Damn. That was harsh.
Kurisu|Oh, whoops. I was supposed to flatter him so he’d feel like going, right?
Kurisu|Yes, you’re an amazing mad scientist.
Rintaro|It’s too late!
Kurisu|Anyway, now that we’ve found the lifter, the time leap machine is 99% complete.
Kurisu|It’s your dream, isn’t it? To invent a time machine.
Rintaro|I will become the undisputed lord of time. With that power, I will shatter the System and Chaos will rule the--
Kurisu|Okabe.
Kurisu|I wasn’t asking Hououin Kyouma. I was asking Okabe.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|I’ll do it. Leave it to me.
Suzuha|’Sup.
Nae|...
Suzuha|That shaking upstairs put the boss in a bad mood. Nae and I are waiting it out.
Nae|Um... are you okay? Dad hit you pretty hard...
Rintaro|I’ll have you know that my brain is more valuable than the Mona Lisa! Your father may have set humanity back a hundred years by wiping out my brain cells.
Suzuha|Such a regrettable loss.
Nae|I’m sorry... Daddy did something bad...
Rintaro|Chipmunk... what a gentle heart you have!
Rintaro|I suppose I share some of the blame. Your father and I are even.
Rintaro|Now then, Part-Time Warrior. I have a request of you.
Rintaro|I need you to distract Mister Braun for about five seconds.
Suzuha|You mean seduce him?
Suzuha|Go on, touch it.
Rintaro|Nobody said anything about seduction. It doesn’t matter how you do it.
Suzuha|I’m not much of a warrior if I can’t handle that. Besides, you said you’d help me search for my father, right? I’m only returning the favor.
Rintaro|I see. Then I leave it in your capable hands.
Suzuha|Okey-dokey!
Nae|Suzuha? Don’t be mean to Daddy, okay?
Suzuha|Ahaha! Don’t worry. I won’t be mean.
Rintaro|Indeed.
Suzuha|Wait here, Nae.
Tennouji|If you came to apologize, I’ll listen. But your rent’s going up, understand?
Rintaro|I’m sorry about what happened. I overreacted.
Rintaro|As a token of apology, my lab’s representative, Amane Suzuha, would like to present you with a gift.
Suzuha|Boss... get ready!
Suzuha|Yaah!
Tennouji|Mwoah!?
Suzuha|Okabe Rintaro, now’s your chance!
Suzuha|Hurry!
Rintaro|W-well done, Warrior! Your heroism will be remembered!
Tennouji|Mmm, mmmmmhmh! Mhmhmhmhmhhmh!MhmhhmhmhmmhmhmhhhhmmhmhmHmhm!
Suzuha|It’s shaking again, Okabe Rintaro. What’s going on?
Rintaro|You’re a lifesaver, Part-Time Warrior! If you can, keep him restrained for ten more seconds!
Nae|...
Suzuha|Come on, boss! Give me back my jacket!
Tennouji|Shaddap. I’m confiscating this.
Suzuha|You pervert!
Tennouji|You’re the pervert, throwing your shirt in my face like some kinda dancer. That was pretty kinky. Gotta remember to thank Okabe, after I kill him.
Suzuha|K-kinky? Don’t say things like that... it’s gross...
Tennouji|Anyway, you can work like that for the rest of the day. Go stand out front and use that flat tummy of yours to attract customers.
Suzuha|I’ll tell Nae on you!
Tennouji|Hah! Who’s she gonna believe? You, or her old man?
Suzuha|Damn...
Mayuri|Okarin? Can you come here?
Mayuri|Can you hold this for me? Spread it out like ’fwapp!’
Itaru|Mayu-shi, say ’fwapp’ again.
Mayuri|Fwapp!
Itaru|I got a fwapp!
Kurisu|Stop it already, perv.
Mayuri|Hmm...
Mayuri|Okay. Thanks!
Mayuri|Finished♪
Rintaro|It’s done?
Mayuri|Yup. I finished before Chris-chan. We were racing.
Kurisu|You win, Mayuri. Congratulations.
Kurisu|Actually, I’m just about finished too.
Kurisu|Done.
Mayuri|It’s a tie...
Itaru|Man, I’m tired... I want Faris-tan to comfort me...
Kurisu|We may have created a monster here...
Rintaro|Why don’t we decide what to call it first?
Rintaro|I vote Heavenly Express!
Itaru|PhoneWave 3rd Edition ver1.00.
Mayuri|Silly Hat PhoneWave-chan.
Kurisu|You guys have too much free time.
Rintaro|Does that mean you’re abstaining from the vote?
Kurisu|...Time Leap Machine.
Itaru|That’s terrible.
Kurisu|C-come on! Simple is best, right? I mean, that’s what Okabe’s been calling it for the past two days.
Rintaro|Looks like my assistant has zero naming sense.
Kurisu|I don’t want to hear that from a chuunibyou headcase like you.
Itaru|Oh-ho! So Makise-shi knows the word chuunibyou... I sense your otaku level is quite high.
Kurisu|I... heard it from a friend. I have no idea where it comes from!
Rintaro|It’s up to you, Mayuri. Choose one.
Mayuri|Hmmm...
Mayuri|I think Time Leap Machine is fine.
Mayuri|Silly Hat PhoneWave-chan is super close though...
Itaru|Somehow I knew she’d say that.
Kurisu|Like I said, simple is best. Mayuri gets it.
Mayuri|Ehehe!
Rintaro|Very well. Time Leap Machine it is.
Rintaro|Assistant! Explain for us all how the Time Leap Machine works.
Kurisu|In short, this device converts memories to data and sends them to the past.
Kurisu|Let’s begin with what we all know. By freak coincidence, the PhoneWave is able to produce ring singularities, much like John Titor’s time machine.
Kurisu|Through the ring singularity, we are able to send up to 36 bytes of data to the past.
Kurisu|The signal can only be received by phones. While that does limit the range of effect, it also removes an element of uncertainty from the equation.
Kurisu|Unlike D-Mails, memory data is sent in the form of a phone call, so we will be using a phone number, not an email address, to set the destination.
Kurisu|The ring singularity is made naked and stable by a device known as a lifter. In our case, that’s the 42-inch CRT downstairs.
Kurisu|The PhoneWave now has headgear attached.
Kurisu|This headgear records the nerve impulses in the temporal lobe of the brain -- specifically, the CA3 region of the hippocampus, where memories are stored.
Kurisu|Then, using VR technology, we encode the nerve impulses into electrical signal data.
Itaru|It comes out to approximately 3.24 terabytes.
Kurisu|By the way, we’ll set it up so that the data decodes automatically after a certain amount of time.
Kurisu|Anybody well versed in programming can do this. I had Hashida make the code.
Kurisu|Anyway, next we send the memory data through the net to the LHC in France.
Rintaro|How long does it take to send 3.24 terabytes of data?
Itaru|We have 64 direct lines in parallel. So if we send it in 64 parts...
Itaru|It should upload in about 45 seconds.
Kurisu|Next, we hijack the LHC, create a mini black hole, and use that black hole’s supergravity to compress the data into 36 bytes.
Rintaro|Will the compression take long?
Itaru|It’s practically instantaneous. 23 milliseconds or thereabouts. We’re using a black hole, after all.
Kurisu|By the way, the compression only holds in the immediate vicinity of the black hole. Once the data leaves that area, it will begin to decompress on its own.
Kurisu|This, too, takes 23 milliseconds.
Itaru|It has to make it back to the X68000 and into the PhoneWave within that window.
Itaru|It’s only 36 bytes. Shouldn’t be a problem.
Rintaro|Continue, Christina.
Kurisu|While the data is being compressed, we use the PhoneWave to generate a Kerr ring singularity. When the electron discharge phenomenon occurs, we take the 36-byte data, patch it in...
Kurisu|And send it to the past.
Kurisu|This part is just like a D-Mail.
Kurisu|The data travels to the specified time, where it arrives at the recipient’s phone.
Kurisu|By now, 23 milliseconds should have passed, so the data will be fully decompressed.
Kurisu|Next, the decoding program runs, converting the data back into nerve impulse signals.
Kurisu|These signals are discharged from from the phone’s earpiece at approximately 0.02 amperes, a pretty weak charge.
Kurisu|If the recipient has the phone to his ear, they should go straight into his brain.
Rintaro|Assuming he answers his phone.
Kurisu|If he doesn’t, the transfer fails. Fortunately, we lose nothing but that copy of the memory data.
Rintaro|Why a phone call instead of an email?
Kurisu|Because we need the recipient to put the phone to his ear. Otherwise the signals won’t reach his temporal lobe.
Kurisu|In this area you have the frontal lobe and temporal lobe of the brain. As I explained before, the hippocampus, where memories are stored, is inside the temporal lobe.
Kurisu|The phone sends out electrical impulses that pass through the temporal lobe and into the hippocampus, overwriting the recipient’s memories.
Kurisu|At the same time, the phone sends impulses that stimulate the frontal lobe as well. This is important.
Kurisu|Remember that the frontal lobe is responsible for sending retrieval signals to the temporal lobe. This is how you remember things.
Kurisu|By stimulating the frontal lobe, we force it to send retrieval signals keyed to the new memory data.
Kurisu|Thus, the recipient recalls all of those memories as if they were his own.
Kurisu|Which, of course, they are, or will be in the future.
Kurisu|This happens in less than a second.
Kurisu|Now the recipient has the same memories as the sender. The time leap is complete.
Kurisu|If the data came from one week in the future, the recipient will ’remember’ that week as if he experienced it firsthand.
Kurisu|We need to be aware that consciousness and personality aren’t transferred. Both of those depend on the recipient.
Itaru|Explain it with boobs.
Kurisu|B-boobs!?
Rintaro|Let’s say we send your memories to you in grade school.
Rintaro|Right now, you’re some kind of omnisexual pervert who thinks inanimate objects are hot. But in elementary school, you were still an innocent child.
Itaru|I was a boring little bastard who did nothing but study, what of it?
Rintaro|Basically, that little bastard would suddenly have all your perverted memories, but his personality wouldn’t change.
Rintaro|It’s not like you’ll become that famous anime detective with ’the looks of a child and the brains of an adult’.
Itaru|What? That sucks.
Kurisu|Ahem.
Kurisu|Um, since you need a phone to receive the signal, you can only send memories to the times you had one.
Kurisu|We also need to make sure that the sender and recipient are the same person.
Kurisu|If someone besides your past self -- your parents, or a friend, for instance -- answers the phone, then the nerve impulse signals will be projected into their brain instead.
Kurisu|If that happens, your memories could overwrite theirs, which could obviously cause serious damage to their psyche.
Rintaro|So.
Rintaro|What do we do with it?
Itaru|Do with what?
Rintaro|The Time Leap Machine, of course. What do we do with it?
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|It’s too much for us to handle, that’s for sure. The safest thing would be to hand it over to the government for professional research.
Itaru|It just doesn’t feel real.
Mayuri|Mayushii doesn’t get it...
Itaru|That’s ’cause you didn’t work on it, Mayu-shi.
Mayuri|Oh, right. Ehehe!
Kurisu|What about you, Okabe? And I mean you, not Hououin Kyouma.
Rintaro|I want to experiment.
Rintaro|But there are still questions we need to answer.
Rintaro|...Who will time leap?
Kurisu|...It’s hard to choose.
Itaru|I’ll pass.
Mayuri|...?
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|It’s not like SERN’s time machine. The possibility of becoming a jellyman is zero.
Kurisu|This machine sends data, not the real thing.
Kurisu|Don’t let your preconceptions influence your decision.
Kurisu|You might say it’s like a cut-and-paste of your brain.
Kurisu|Actually, it’s more like a copy-paste. And it’s just your memories.
Kurisu|The original doesn’t get erased.
Rintaro|What if there’s an error somewhere, and the data itself gets fractalized?
Rintaro|Let’s say I send my memories an hour into the past.
Rintaro|My memories would be replaced by fractalized data. In other words, data full of tiny holes.
Rintaro|Couldn’t that cause memory loss?
Kurisu|...I suppose.
Rintaro|One hour later, we arrive once again at the present. At that time, the me who lost his memories an hour ago and the current me conflict in my brain.
Rintaro|Which data set survives?
Kurisu|...Logically, the present should change as soon as you send your memories to the past.
Rintaro|So then it’s not a copy-paste at all, is it?
Kurisu|I don’t know. No one’s ever experienced time travel before.
Rintaro|When we send a D-Mail, the world is reconstructed based on the change we made to the past.
Kurisu|We don’t know what happens when you time leap.
Kurisu|If it’s the many-worlds interpretation like Titor said, then the instant you time leap, it creates two possibilities -- one where you shift to another worldline, and one where you travel back in time on the same worldline.
Kurisu|Of course, there must also be a worldline where the current you doesn’t disappear. That would likely correspond to the present that we are experiencing right now.
Mayuri|???
Rintaro|I thought you didn’t believe what Titor had to say.
Kurisu|I’m talking hypothetically. Titor doesn’t matter right now.
Kurisu|If it’s the Copenhagen interpretation, then every possible state propagates through space as a wave function. When a particular state is observed, the remaining states collapse and that state is fixed.
Rintaro|The problem is who the observer is in this case.
Itaru|Wouldn’t it be a third party? Like me, or Mayu-shi.
Mayuri|...?
Rintaro|Not necessarily. It might be me. It might be someone else. It could even be God.
Rintaro|In the end, we arrive at the question of ’where is the self?’
Kurisu|This Time Leap Machine only sends memories. That, I guarantee.
Itaru|Won’t the present be reconstructed at the moment of transfer?
Itaru|That’s what happens with Okarin’s Reading Steiner, right?
Rintaro|That makes sense where D-Mails are concerned. When we send a D-Mail, we’re obviously interfering in past events.
Rintaro|But time leaping is different. All you do is send your memories to the past, which isn’t the same thing as sending a targeted D-Mail.
Rintaro|Whether the me who suddenly ’remembers’ one hour into the future will, in fact, change the past is something we can’t know until it happens.
Itaru|I’m getting confused.
Itaru|It sounds like we’re talking about the soul. Isn’t that a religious question?
Kurisu|Wait. You guys are misunderstanding something.
Kurisu|One hour isn’t enough time for your personality to change. You should be the same person one hour ago that you are now.
Kurisu|The only difference is that you’ll have an extra hour’s worth of memories.
Rintaro|How can you be sure?
Kurisu|...Well, I can’t. Nobody’s tried it before.
Mayuri|So, which is it?
Kurisu|We don’t know. We can argue the theories all we want, but in the end, we can only guess.
Kurisu|This experiment may end up shattering preconceptions scientists and philosophers have held for centuries.
Mayuri|Hey...
Mayuri|Um, I have an idea...
Mayuri|Why don’t we make a banana time leap instead?
Kurisu|Oh Mayuri...
Kurisu|Bananas don’t have brains like people do.
Mayuri|Oh... you need a brain, huh...
Rintaro|Let’s not experiment.
Rintaro|We’ll entrust the Time Leap Machine to a suitable research institution. Then we’ll announce it to the world.
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|Are you upset?
Kurisu|Upset?
Rintaro|About our decision not to attempt a Time Leap experiment.
Kurisu|No, I’m not upset.
Kurisu|’Humans are temporal beings.’
Kurisu|That’s a Heidegger quote.
Kurisu|I was actually relieved when you made the decision not to use the machine.
Kurisu|If you hadn’t been there, I might not have been able to stop myself.
Kurisu|Thank you.
Kurisu|Uh, what are you doing?
Rintaro|You’re talking like an assistant for a change. I thought you might have a fever.
Kurisu|I’m not grateful to you or anything, okay!?
Kurisu|Anyway.
Kurisu|That ’thank you’ was just a formality. Don’t get me wrong, okay?
Rintaro|Of course. I only did what I had to.
Rintaro|I am the founder of the Future Gadget Lab, Hououin Kyouma. My first priority is to protect the welfare of my lab mems.
Rintaro|So I have no need for your thanks.
Kurisu|And yet you always talk about plunging the world into chaos.
Rintaro|You are my allies, and the world is my enemy.
Kurisu|I’m speechless. You’re too self-righteous.
Rintaro|You say ’speechless,’ yet you’re speaking?
Kurisu|Don’t argue semantics.
Kurisu|Oh yeah, I forgot to get a plane ticket.
Kurisu|I got too caught up in improving the PhoneWave.
Rintaro|Going public with the Time Leap Machine will send the world into an uproar. We also plan to expose SERN, remember? You may not be able to go back to America for some time.
Kurisu|I guess you’re right. I should call Mama and let her know.
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ I’m back!
Suzuha|Man, that was terrible. I was stuck looking like an exhibitionist all day.
Rintaro|Daru, why did you order the exact same pizza as before!?
Itaru|Because I like it.
Mayuri|Okarin, Okarin.
Mayuri|I called Feris-chan and Luka-chan, but they said they couldn’t come.
Rintaro|Oh. Do they have plans?
Mayuri|Feris-chan has a RaiNet tournament.
Itaru|Crap, I should’ve gone to cheer! How careless of me!
Mayuri|And Luka-chan seemed embarrassed for some reason.
Kurisu|Maybe she thinks you’ll make her wear a costume again.
Rintaro|You still haven’t convinced her to cosplay?
Mayuri|She said it was embarrassing. I keep telling her ’Cuteness is Justice’, but she never listens.
Kurisu|’Cuteness is Justice’... is that what they say?
Mayuri|You’re cute too, Chris-chan!
Kurisu|Hah? Eh?
Mayuri|Hey, ComiMa’s coming up. Wanna go?
Mayuri|I can’t make something new, but I have a costume of Post-Awakening Seira from Blood Tune I made last year. I think the size is just right for Chris-chan too.
Kurisu|Me, cosplay?
Kurisu|I’m sorta interested.
Kurisu|But I refuse to do it in public, though.
Mayuri|You don’t have to show anyone, but eventually, you’ll want them to see. The cosplay demon compels you!
Mayuri|That reminds me. Chris-chan, you’re always wearing that cute uniform. What school is it from?
Kurisu|Oh, this?
Kurisu|I attended Ayamein for about two weeks. I modeled this outfit after their uniform.
Mayuri|Oh! Their uniform is really cute, but you made it even cuter! You might have really good design sense♪
Mayuri|I’ll bring the costume tomorrow, okay? Will you try it on then?
Kurisu|Sure.
Itaru|When’s the photo shoot?
Kurisu|Good to know you’re still a pervert, Hashida.
Itaru|Come on, it’s Blood Tune’s Seira! She’s got ’panmoro’ going on!
Kurisu|Panmoro?
Itaru|It means her panties are completely exposed!
Kurisu|N-no way...
Mayuri|It’s okay♪
Mayuri|You might not know this, but last year, there was a really popular saying.
Mayuri|’They’re not panties, so it’s not embarrassing!’
Kurisu|It’s plenty embarrassing, trust me!
Mayuri|Wear it, okay? It’s a promise!
Suzuha|Maybe you shouldn’t bother.
Suzuha|You’re asking for trouble by trusting Makise Kurisu.
Kurisu|What’s that supposed to mean?
Kurisu|I’ve been meaning to ask. Did I do something to you?
Suzuha|Not to me. But I know everything you have done.
Kurisu|What do you mean? I’ve done nothing to be guilty of.
Suzuha|Perhaps. But I know your true nature.
Kurisu|Wow, you can see into my heart? That’s groundbreaking technology. I’d love to hear how it works.
Suzuha|It’s not science. It’s... a prediction.
Kurisu|So you’re just making it up.
Suzuha|I know.
Mayuri|Okarin.
Mayuri|Stop them from fighting.
Rintaro|Heh... this looks like a job for the one and only Hououin Kyouma.
Rintaro|Break it up, you two! I, Hououin Kyouma, shall decide this dispute!
Rintaro|Assistant! I didn’t raise you this way.
Kurisu|You didn’t raise me at all.
Rintaro|If you want to become a true mad scientist, you must learn to keep your emotions in check even as you cackle your way to victory!
Kurisu|Nobody asked you. And I’m already a scientist.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Warrior! Your enemy is SERN, remember? You must conserve your strength for Ragnarok.
Suzuha|I warned you before, Okabe Rintaro. Makise Kurisu is a threat.
Rintaro|Wha--
Kurisu|Oh? What’s this about, Okabe?
Rintaro|MUHAHAHA!
Rintaro|Looks like neither of you is willing to back down. So be it! Fight to your hearts’ content! Fight until there is no more fight to be had! Then, share a manly handshake by the river and let friendship blossom!
Rintaro|But in the future, when it comes time for you to venture out into the real world, I hope you remember one thing...
Rintaro|Nobody likes a mood-killer!
Kurisu & Suzuha|Shut up!
Rintaro|Gah! Why now, of all times!? Calm down, right arm of mine!
Rintaro|I’m sorry, Mayuri. At his rate, I’ll end up hurting those two. I have no choice... the rest is up to you...
Mayuri|Geez...
Mayuri|Um, guys? Mayushii doesn’t like it when you fight. Let’s all get along, okay?
Mayuri|Hey, Okarin.
Rintaro|Hm?
Mayuri|It’s been really lively here these past few weeks, huh?
Rintaro|Yeah, I guess it has.
Mayuri|It’s fun♪
Mayuri|Um, now that there are eight lab mems, Mayushii thinks it’s getting a little cramped in here.
Mayuri|First, we don’t have enough chairs.
Mayuri|We should buy more. Do you have money, Okarin?
Rintaro|New chairs will take all my savings.
Mayuri|I guess you can use some of my salary.
Mayuri|We need a new microwave too. Otherwise, I can’t warm up my Juicy Chicken Number One.
Rintaro|Yeah, sorry about that.
Rintaro|But Mayuri. When we turn over the Time Leap Machine, the reward money will solve all of our problems.
Mayuri|Will it be enough to pay for chairs and a microwave on top of the higher rent?
Rintaro|It’ll be enough. More than enough.
Mayuri|Wow! That’s great, Okarin♪
Rintaro|Why are you so happy?
Mayuri|Just look. We’ve made so many friends.
Mayuri|There’s Daru-kun, Chris-chan, Luka-chan, Suzu-san, Moeka-san, Feris-chan, Braun-san, Nae-chan, and more!
Mayuri|In the spring, when you started this lab, you seemed so lonely.
Mayuri|But now you’re fine.
Mayuri|You don’t need me to be your hostage anymore.
Rintaro|What do you--
Suzuha|A bomb threat?
Itaru|Hang on. Those lines all pass through Akiba. How is Mayu-shi gonna get home?
Mayuri|Oh yeah. I should call home.
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|Okabe Rintaro. I need to know.
Suzuha|You’ve completed the Time Leap Machine, right?
Rintaro|Huh? Well, yeah...
Suzuha|Okay.
Suzuha|I just remembered I’ve got something to do. I’m going out.
Kurisu|What’s wrong with her?
Kurisu|We may have created a monster here...
Attacker A|Hands in the air. Nobody move.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Kiryu... Moeka...
Mayuri|Um... Moeka-san?
Moeka|We’re taking the time machine.
Moeka|Makise Kurisu, Okabe Rintaro, Hashida Itaru. The three of you will come with us.
Rintaro|What’s going on here?
Moeka|I can’t answer that.
Rintaro|This is a joke... right?
Moeka|You don’t need to know.
Moeka|You can’t resist.
Moeka|Come with us.
Rintaro|W-where?
Moeka|...
Rintaro|I’m n-not going anywhere until you answer.
Moeka|You can’t refuse.
Moeka|You have nowhere to run.
Moeka|We have men stationed throughout Akihabara.
Moeka|I don’t want to hurt anyone.
Moeka|The three of you, come with us.
Kurisu|Why...
Kurisu|Why just the three of us?
Moeka|I’m not answering your questions.
Moeka|Come with us. It’s your only choice.
Itaru|O-Okarin...
Itaru|D-don’t you think we should do what she says?
Rintaro|But unless she tells me the reason...
Mayuri|M-Moeka-san, you’re a lab mem too... aren’t you?
Moeka|Our mission...
Moeka|Is to silence you.
Moeka|Your refusal to come will change nothing.
Rintaro|Who sent you? Who are you people!?
Moeka|We...
Moeka|...are from SERN.
Attacker A|M4!
Attacker A|Watch your tongue!
Moeka|...
Moeka|Come with us. Now.
Moeka|If you continue to resist, I’ll have to resort to extreme measures.
Mayuri|...
Moeka|Shiina Mayuri is not needed.
Rintaro|Stop!
Rintaro|Gah!
Mayuri|Okarin!
Kurisu|Mayuri! No!
Moeka|For SERN... for FB... for SERN... for FB...
Itaru|Wahhhhhhhhhhh!
Mayuri|O...kari...
Mayuri|...
Rintaro|...Mayuri?
Kurisu|No... no!
Moeka|You three come with us. Now.
Moeka|No more warnings.
Moeka|Resist, and we’ll kill you too.
Rintaro|Ah... AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Kurisu|Okabe!
Kurisu|You can’t!
Rintaro|Let me go! Let me go!
Kurisu|You can’t! They’ll kill you!
Rintaro|You gonna kill me too!?
Moeka|If you resist.
Kurisu|Please, Okabe, do what she says. Okay?
Kurisu|Otherwise, they’ll kill you too.
Kurisu|No!
Moeka|...!?
???|Get down!
Attacker B|Gweh!!
Attacker A|Who the hell!?
Attacker A|Gwah!!
Moeka|Enough.
Suzuha|!!
Moeka|Who are you?
Suzuha|42.
Suzuha|TV.
Suzuha|Turned on.
Moeka|What...
Moeka|Don’t move!
Suzuha|That’s my line!
Moeka|...Tch.
Kurisu|Okabe...
Rintaro|I’m going back!
Kurisu|No! I should be the one to--
Rintaro|I will save Mayuri!
Kurisu|But what if it fails!?
Suzuha|Okabe Rintaro! One of them’s moving!
Moeka|Get in there! Kill them!
Attacker A|Damn... kids!
Moeka|Kill them!
Kurisu|Augh!
Rintaro|Kurisu!?
Kurisu|Ugh, gh, Okabe!! Are you sure!?
Kurisu|Are you sure about this!? Really!?
Rintaro|Do it, Kurisu! Activate the machine!
Rintaro|Agh!
Rintaro|Leaaaaaaaap!!
Rintaro|Mayuri?
Rintaro|...Mayuri?
Rintaro|Mayuri?
Rintaro|Mayuri?
Mayuri|...
Rintaro|I won’t let you go.
Rintaro|I won’t let anyone take you away.
Rintaro|You’re my hostage now. My guinea pig!
Rintaro|T-there is no escaping me! Muhaha, muhahaha!
Mayuri|Oh... sniff...
Mayuri|Mayushii’s your hostage...
Mayuri|I guess I’m stuck here, huh? Ehehe...
Rintaro|AHHHHHHHHHHH!
Rintaro|Aagh, ahhhh!!
Rintaro|Ah!
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Ahhh...
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|...ckhaah, haahh, haahh, hah...
Kurisu|Okabe? Are you listening?
Kurisu|What was all that screaming for?
Kurisu|Are you sick?
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|...No, I’m fine.
Kurisu|Then get ready to go already. We’re going shopping, remember?
Rintaro|...Shopping?
Kurisu|’Humans are temporal beings.’
Mayuri|But now you’re fine.
Kurisu|Are you sure about this!? Really!?
Rintaro|Ah... ah...
Kurisu|You’ll remember the future.
Rintaro|Where am I?
Kurisu|Huh?
Rintaro|What time is it now!? What month? What day!?
Kurisu|Hey, that hurts! Calm down!
Rintaro|How can I be calm!? Shopping? You said we’re going shopping?
Rintaro|Daru! What day is it!? What time is it!?
Itaru|Uh, ummm, well, it’s the 13th... a little past 5.
Rintaro|...Did it work?
Rintaro|...Where’s Mayuri?
Rintaro|Where’s Mayuri!?
Itaru|Uh, she just left saying she was going to Luka-shi’s place. Weren’t you listening?
Rintaro|Whew...
Rintaro|It must have been a dream.
Rintaro|There’s no way something like that could really happen.
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ I’m back!
Mayuri|Okarin, Okarin.
Mayuri|I called Feris-chan and Luka-chan, but they said they couldn’t come.
Rintaro|Oh. Do they have plans?
Mayuri|Feris-chan has a RaiNet tournament.
Itaru|Crap, I should’ve gone to cheer! How careless of me!

Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Okarin... are you okay? You don’t look so good.
Rintaro|It’s nothing...
Mayuri|Are you feeling sick? Then you need to rest. Want to lie down? You can lie on my lap, okay?
Rintaro|I’m not--
Suzuha|A bomb threat?
Itaru|Hang on. Those lines all pass through Akiba. How is Mayu-shi gonna get home?
Mayuri|Oh yeah. I should call home.
Rintaro|No... it can’t be...
Suzuha|Okabe Rintaro. I need to know.
Suzuha|You’ve completed the Time Leap Machine, right?
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|Are you listening?
Itaru|Uh, the Time Leap Machine’s done.
Suzuha|Okay.
Suzuha|I just remembered I’ve got something to do. I’m going out.
Kurisu|What’s wrong with her?
Attacker A|Hands in the air. Nobody move.
Moeka|...
Mayuri|M-Moeka-san?
Moeka|We’re taking the time machine.
Moeka|Makise Kurisu, Okabe Rintaro, Hashida Itaru. The three of you will come with us.
Moeka|You can’t resist.
Moeka|Come with us.
Rintaro|...
Itaru|W-where?
Moeka|...
Kurisu|At least tell us where we’re going.
Moeka|You cannot refuse.
Moeka|There is nowhere to run.
Moeka|We have men stationed throughout Akihabara.
Moeka|I don’t want to hurt anyone.
Moeka|The three of you come with us.
Kurisu|Why just the three of us?
Moeka|I’m not answering your questions.
Moeka|Come with us. It’s your only choice.
Mayuri|M-Moeka-san, you’re a lab mem too... aren’t you?
Moeka|Our mission...
Moeka|Is to silence you.
Moeka|Your refusal to come will change nothing.
Moeka|Come with us. Now.
Moeka|If you continue to resist, I’ll have to resort to extreme measures.
Mayuri|...
Moeka|Shiina Mayuri is not needed.
Moeka|For SERN... for FB... for SERN... for FB...
Itaru|Wahhhhhhhhhhh!
Mayuri|O...kari...
Mayuri|...
Kurisu|No... no!
Moeka|You three come with us. Now.
Moeka|No more warnings.
Moeka|Resist, and we will kill you too.
Kurisu|Okabe!
Kurisu|You can’t!
Rintaro|Let me go!
Kurisu|You can’t! They’ll kill you!
Rintaro|You gonna kill me too!?
Moeka|If you resist.
Kurisu|Please, Okabe, do what she says. Okay?
Kurisu|Otherwise, they’ll kill you too.
Rintaro|Gh...!
Moeka|...!?
Suzuha|Get down!
Attacker B|Gweh!!
Attacker A|Who the hell!?
Attacker A|Gwah!!
Moeka|Enough.
Suzuha|!!
Moeka|...Who are you?
Suzuha|42.
Suzuha|TV.
Suzuha|Turned on.
Moeka|Don’t move!
Suzuha|That’s my line!
Kurisu|Okabe, I--
Rintaro|I’m going back!
Kurisu|But what if it fails!?
Rintaro|Get the machine started!
Suzuha|Okabe Rintaro! One of them’s headed your way!
Moeka|Kill them! Don’t let them use it!
Kurisu|Are you sure, Okabe!?
Kurisu|Are you sure about this!? Really!?
Rintaro|Do it, Kurisu! Activate the machine!
Rintaro|Please! Give me one more chance!
Rintaro|Ah!
Rintaro|...Gh.
Rintaro|...It worked again.
Kurisu|Kya! You surprised me!
Kurisu|Don’t startle me like that.
Rintaro|Daru! Is it just before 5 on the 13th!? 
Itaru|Eh? Um... yeah?
Rintaro|You’re a genius.
Kurisu|W-what’s gotten in to you? Stop manhandling me. It’s gross.
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Mayushii here.
Rintaro|Mayuri! Where are--
Mayuri|But I can’t answer the phone right now.
Mayuri|Please leave your message after the beep♪
Rintaro|Mayuri! Contact me at once! Okay? At once!
Kurisu|Okabe? You look kind of crazy. What’s wrong?
Rintaro|Both of you get out of here. Now.
Kurisu|...What’s this about?
Kurisu|Is this another one of your fantasies?
Kurisu|Okabe! Where are you going? Hey!
Rintaro|Lukako!
Luka|...Ah, Okabe-san!
Luka|What’s wrong?
Rintaro|Mayuri! Where’s Mayuri!?
Luka|Um, Mayuri-chan already left.
Rintaro|She left!?
Luka|Yes...
Luka|Um... when you see her, could you tell her that I’m sorry?
Luka|I’d really prefer not to cosplay...
Luka|I don’t want to disappoint her, but it’s too embarrassing to dress like that in front of people...
Rintaro|Mayuri went back to the lab?
Luka|Eh? Um... I think so.
Rintaro|She didn’t say she was dropping by somewhere?
Luka|No... I didn’t ask...
Luka|Um... is something wrong?
Rintaro|If Mayuri comes back here, tell her to call me right away!
Luka|O-okay!
Rintaro|Where’s Mayuri!? Did she come back!?
Itaru|Huh? No.
Rintaro|Kuh! Where is she!?
Itaru|Hey, Okarin. Why are you so jumpy?
Rintaro|I need to find Mayuri!
Itaru|Isn’t she at Luka-shi’s?
Rintaro|Not anymore. She was gone by the time I got there.
Itaru|Maybe she went to see one of her cosplay friends?
Rintaro|Who? What’s her phone number?
Itaru|How should I know?
Itaru|Ah, now that you mention it.
Rintaro|Do you know something!?
Itaru|I think she said that her phone was about to run out of power. She had to turn it off.
Itaru|Hey, what’s going on?
Rintaro|...Why are you still here, Daru? I thought I told you to leave!
Itaru|I’m not leaving without a good reason.
Itaru|Tell me what’s going on, man.
Rintaro|...They’re going to kill Mayuri.
Itaru|What?
Rintaro|SERN’s after us. In two hours, their men will break in and kill Mayuri. Get out while you still can!
Itaru|What? For real?
Rintaro|Can you get in touch with Kurisu? Pass the message onto her.
Itaru|In two hours? How do you know that?
Itaru|No way. You used it?
Suzuha|Huh?
Suzuha|What are you doing here, Okabe Rintaro?
Rintaro|Nothing...
Suzuha|Oh, I know! You’re getting ready for that party tonight, aren’t you?
Rintaro|How did you know we’re having a party?
Suzuha|Shiina Mayuri. She came by earlier today to invite me over.
Suzuha|Hope you’ve got room for one more, ’cuz I’m--
Rintaro|You can’t!
Suzuha|...
Suzuha|Um... am I a bother?
Rintaro|...No.
Suzuha|It’s okay. I understand. I guess I’m still an outsider.
Rintaro|That’s not it!
Tennouji|What’s wrong with you, Okabe?
Tennouji|Let my part-timer join your little club. You owe her, remember? It’s thanks to her belly that I let ya’ off the hook for shaking the building last time.
Suzuha|My belly? Hey!
Tennouji|She’s got a fine belly. Tight and well trained.
Suzuha|I’m standing right here, you dirty old man.
Rintaro|The party is canceled. I’m sorry, Part-Time Warrior, but please go home today.
Suzuha|Canceled?
Rintaro|Yeah. Sorry.
Tennouji|I don’t know what’s going on, Okabe, but don’t do anything reckless.
Rintaro|...Huh?
Rintaro|I... got in a fight with Mayuri. Things are a little complicated right now. That’s all.
Suzuha|Oh, is there gonna be blood?
Suzuha|I mean, look over there.
Suzuha|Huh? Weren’t you fighting? She looks really happy to see you.
Suzuha|Hey! Where are you going!?
Mayuri|What’s the rush, Okarin?
Rintaro|Run! To the station!
Mayuri|Wawawa...
Mayuri|W-w-wait! My bag...
Rintaro|Forget it! Just run!
Mayuri|Eh? Why?
Rintaro|Just run!
Mayuri|Hey, where are we going?
Rintaro|Haah, haah, haah, first we’ll head for, haah, Tsukuba or Yokohama...
Mayuri|Shouldn’t we rest a bit?
Rintaro|No... stopping... until... we’re on... the train...
Mayuri|But Okarin, you’re covered in sweat. You shouldn’t push yourself. You’re not good at exercise.
Premise Announcer|Your attention please. The Yamanote, Keihin-Tohoku, and Sobu Lines are currently suspended.
Premise Announcer|We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, and kindly ask for your cooperation.
Mayuri|I wonder what happened...
???|Okabe Rintaro?
Mayuri|Okarin, do you know these people?
???|Come with us.
Rintaro|Who are you?
???|If you resist, we’ll kill you.
Rintaro|SERN!
Rintaro|Are you going to kill us with all these witnesses around?
???|This isn’t a game.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Run, Mayuri!
Mayuri|Where are we going, Okarin!?
Rintaro|Haah, haah, okay, Mayuri, you’re, a faster, haah, haah, runner, so...
Rintaro|You, go on, ahead! Go, to Hariti shrine, in Ikebukuro. We’ll meet--
Mayuri|What’s going on, Okarin!?
Moeka|You have nowhere to run.
Moeka|We have men stationed throughout Akihabara.
Rintaro|...!?
Rintaro|Gah...hah...
Rintaro|Ma... yuri...
Rintaro|Mayuri...
Moeka|...I’ve stopped them.
Moeka|I’ve secured Okabe-kun... I mean, Okabe Rintaro.
Moeka|Contact the police. Shiina Mayuri is dead.
Rintaro|Why... why did you kill her!?
Moeka|Because you ran.
Rintaro|You monster!
Moeka|!?
Rintaro|Of course I should.
Rintaro|Mayuri’s dead, remember?
Rintaro|Gah!
Rintaro|Where’s Mayuri!?
Kurisu|Wha!?
Kurisu|Don’t shout...
Kurisu|I’ve been working all night, so let me rest a bit...
Rintaro|Where is Mayuri!?
Itaru|What’s wrong with you? She went to Luka-shi’s, remember?
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Mayushii here.
Rintaro|Mayuri! Where are--
Mayuri|But I can’t answer the phone right now.
Mayuri|Please leave your message after the beep♪
Luka|Hello. This is Urushibara.
Rintaro|Lukako! It’s me! Okabe!
Luka|Okabe-san? What’s wrong?
Rintaro|Is Mayuri there? If she is, let me speak to her!
Luka|Okay. Just a moment please.
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Mayushii here. What’s up, Okarin?
Rintaro|Where are you now? Yanabayashi Shrine!?
Mayuri|Yup!
Rintaro|I’m headed there now. Whatever you do, don’t move, okay!?
Mayuri|Huh? Why not?
Kurisu|What’s all the commotion?
Rintaro|Daru. Assistant. Leave right now and get as far from Akiba as you can. But under no circumstances use the train.
Itaru|What? Why?
Rintaro|If you can, go somewhere you don’t normally go, and stay there overnight. Understand?
Itaru|Wait, overnight? So you’re saying we should go to a love hotel and make hanky panky. I understand.
Kurisu|Shut it, perv.
Kurisu|What’s going on, Okabe?
Rintaro|Please, just do as I say. We’ll talk later. Don’t come back to the lab until I say so!
Rintaro|Mayuri!
Mayuri|Okarin♪
Mayuri|Are you here to back me up?
Rintaro|Back you up?
Mayuri|To help convince Luka-chan to wear my costume!
Luka|Mayuri-chan, I really can’t. It’s too embarrassing...
Mayuri|Hey, Okarin. Can you think of some way to persuade Luka-chan?
Mayuri|Mayushii can’t reach the ending for the Luka-chan route.
Luka|I keep telling her I can’t... but Mayuri-chan just won’t give up.
Rintaro|I’m sorry, you two. Save the cosplay talk for later.
Rintaro|Drop your bags, Mayuri. Leave them with Lukako.
Mayuri|Huh? What’s going on?
Rintaro|We’re leaving town.
Mayuri|Leaving town? We’re going on a trip?
Luka|A... trip?
Luka|Just the two of you?
Rintaro|That’s right.
Mayuri|Where are we going, Okarin? What’s the rush?
Rintaro|SERN’s after us.
Mayuri|Huh? What does that mean?
Rintaro|I’ll explain later. First we need to get out of Akiba.
Mayuri|O-okay...
Mayuri|Okarin... Mayushii’s kinda scared...
Rintaro|Hide!
Rintaro|Mayuri, stay right here. Don’t move until I get back.
Mayuri|Where are you going?
Rintaro|To the station to make sure it’s safe.
Mayuri|Mayushii doesn’t want to be left alone...
Rintaro|I’ll be right back. If I’m not back in 30 minutes, call someone. Kurisu or Suzuha. Have them get you out of Akiba.
Mayuri|Don’t say that! Come back, okay? If you don’t, Mayushii won’t know what to do...
Rintaro|Okay. I’ll come back. I promise.
Rintaro|Mayuri!
Rintaro|I told her not to move!
Rintaro|A jellyman...
Rintaro|...!
Rintaro|AHHHHHHHHH!
Rintaro|RintaroGuh!
Mayuri|...?
Mayuri|Um, Okarin? Mayushii has a lot of questions, but she’ll wait for now.
Mayuri|But once it’s over, I want you to tell me everything, okay?
Rintaro|Yeah, I promise.
Rintaro|Where did you go after you saw Lukako?
Mayuri|I got an email from Fubuki-chan. A thread came loose on her costume.
Mayuri|I went to fix it.
Rintaro|Where does Fubuki-chan live?
Mayuri|Um, we met at the Starbecks at UPX.
Mayuri|About the party tonight...
Mayuri|It got canceled, but we should definitely--
???|Mayuri♪
Rintaro|Huh?
Nae|I...
Nae|Saw... Mayuri...
Nae|I wanted... to surprise her...
Nae|It wasn’t on purpo... it... wasn...
Mayuri|Juicy Chicken Number One♪
Mayuri|Eh...
Rintaro|Mayuri, look out!
Mayuri|...!
Rintaro|What--
Rintaro|Wha...
Man Who Stabbed Mayuri|Be quiet, Okabe Rintaro.
Man Who Stabbed Mayuri|Guh!
Rintaro|Open the door!
Rintaro|No! There has to be a way!
Mayuri|Whatcha talking about?
Rintaro|Don’t move.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Hands up.
Rintaro|Sorry to disappoint you. The first gun was a toy.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Talk. I know you were sent by SERN.
Moeka|...How?
Rintaro|How? You want to know how!?
Rintaro|I came from the future, that’s how!
Moeka|...
Rintaro|You think I’m lying? I’ve repeated the last several hours a half-dozen times already.
Rintaro|I know what you’re planning.
Rintaro|Around seven, you’re going to stop the trains.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|I also know that you’re planning to attack the lab. You and your men.
Rintaro|And then you’re going to kill Mayuri!
Moeka|I...
Rintaro|Understand? I’m a time leaper.
Rintaro|Who are you people?
Moeka|...Rounders.
Rintaro|Rounders? What does that mean? How are you related to SERN?
Moeka|...By email.
Rintaro|No! Speak.
Moeka|The Rounders...
Moeka|...are an organization separate from SERN.
Moeka|Covert operations.
Moeka|We don’t exist.
Rintaro|Like a private army?
Moeka|...No.
Moeka|Our mission...
Moeka|...is to find and acquire IBN 5100s.
Moeka|They send us around the world.
Moeka|We collect them.
Rintaro|How many Rounders are there?
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Answer me!
Moeka|I don’t know.
Moeka|I’m just an agent.
Rintaro|Was it you who stole our IBN 5100?
Rintaro|Why does SERN need IBN 5100s? To keep hackers out?
Moeka|Maintaining secrecy...
Moeka|...is the highest priority...
Moeka|...for SERN.
Rintaro|What are they hiding?
Rintaro|We already know they’ve killed hundreds of test subjects with their time travel experiments. We didn’t need an IBN 5100 to find that out.
Rintaro|Are you saying the IBN 5100 database has information more sensitive than that!?
Moeka|I don’t know.
Rintaro|Because you’re just an agent?
Rintaro|Why did you attack the lab? Or rather, why will you attack the lab?
Moeka|...Isn’t it obvious?
Rintaro|Because we hacked into SERN?
Moeka|Three reasons.
Moeka|First. Because of what you know.
Moeka|We were ordered to silence you.
Moeka|Second. For the time machine.
Moeka|The one you made.
Moeka|Third. The reason it happens today.
Moeka|You plan to make your time machine public.
Moeka|That’s why I was ordered... to take you in.
Rintaro|Take us in!? You killed Mayuri!
Moeka|She is... unnecessary.
Moeka|Okabe, Makise, Hashida. You made the time machine.
Moeka|She is expendable.
Moeka|Those are my orders.
Rintaro|And after you take us in? What then?
Moeka|SERN will hold you prisoner. Force you to complete their time travel research.
Rintaro|Have you done this before? How many lives have you ruined for SERN’s research?
Moeka|...I do as I’m told.
Rintaro|I was a fool to consider you my friend.
Moeka|...I live for SERN.
Moeka|...I live for FB.
Moeka|I’ll do anything... if FB tells me to.
Moeka|Okabe-kun...
Moeka|Is it you?
Moeka|Are you John Titor?
Rintaro|...What?
Moeka|There’s no one else it could be.
Rintaro|I don’t have time for this.
Rintaro|If you want to live, you’ll call your friends. Call FB. Cancel the attack.
Moeka|I don’t have the authority.
Rintaro|I don’t care! Find some way to stop the attack. Otherwise...
Rintaro|I’ll kill you.
Rintaro|Why... why did you kill her?
Rintaro|You didn’t want to kill her, did you? So why...
Moeka|I...
Moeka|...just obey...
Moeka|...FB.
Rintaro|Then bring that son-of-a-bitch here!
Rintaro|I don’t care about your authority. If you don’t do what I say--
Moeka|...I can’t.
Moeka|I’ve never--
Attacker A|Drop the gun.
Rintaro|You lied, Kiryu Moeka!
Rintaro|We promised to meet alone!
Moeka|...
Attacker A|I said drop the gun.
Rintaro|I’ll give you the time machine. Just don’t kill anyone.
Moeka|Even if you do that...
Moeka|You’ll still be held prisoner.
Moeka|Forever.
Rintaro|Please...
Rintaro|I’m sorry about the hacking. Just please, don’t kill anyone.
Attacker A|Target B in custody. Requesting pickup.
Rintaro|Aaaaahhhhhh!!
Mayuri|Okarin!
Mayuri|Ah!
Kurisu|Stop, Okabe! What are you doing!?
Kurisu|Are you trying to break the machine?
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|You don’t have to break it, Okabe.
Kurisu|We already decided not to experiment. Remember?
Kurisu|Anyway, put the chair down.
Kurisu|You look pale. What’s wrong?
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|Are you listening?
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|W-wait!
Kurisu|Hey. Don’t you think you’re a little old to be sitting on the ground in public?
Kurisu|So this is where you went. I’ve been looking for you.
Rintaro|...Christina.
Kurisu|What?
Rintaro|What time is it now?
Kurisu|5:38.
Kurisu|Hey. If you have time to sit around, then you can help me with the shopping.
Kurisu|Well? Are you going to come along or not?
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Kurisu.
Kurisu|...That’s the first time you’ve said my name properly.
Rintaro|...Help me.
Rintaro|Help me...
Kurisu|Tell me what happened.
Kurisu|I know you used the Time Leap Machine.
Rintaro|...What?
Kurisu|You get a phone call, and suddenly you’re like a different person.
Kurisu|It was obvious.
Rintaro|I came from three hours in the future.
Kurisu|What happened?
Rintaro|They... killed Mayuri.
Rintaro|...It’s all my fault.
Rintaro|I shouldn’t have told Daru to hack SERN.
Rintaro|I shouldn’t have asked you to build a time machine.
Rintaro|I shouldn’t have made Moeka a lab mem.
Rintaro|Mayuri’s death... is all my fault.
Kurisu|If you know that Mayuri’s going to die, then what are you doing wasting time here?
Rintaro|...I just don’t get it anymore.
Kurisu|What don’t you get?
Rintaro|How to save Mayuri.
Kurisu|Based on what you said, I guess the chronology protection conjecture is true.
Rintaro|No matter what I do, Mayuri dies.
Kurisu|And that’s why you keep time leaping...
Kurisu|There’s no guarantee that the machine is safe, you know.
Kurisu|Even if the machine works perfectly, repeated use may have serious side effects.
Kurisu|For example, you may become disconnected from causality itself.
Kurisu|You need to understand the risks if you’re going to continue.
Rintaro|Disconnected from causality, meaning?
Kurisu|It happens all the time in sci-fi. You’ll become trapped in a closed time loop, never aging, never dying, but doomed to repeat the same day for all eternity.
Kurisu|Worst case, you may cease to exist entirely.
Kurisu|Every trace of your existence will vanish. Nobody will remember you, because your life will have never happened.
Kurisu|Leaping through time is that dangerous.
Rintaro|’Humans are temporal beings.’
Kurisu|Heidegger. I was thinking of that quote too.
Rintaro|I heard it from you first.
Kurisu|When?
Rintaro|This isn’t the first time I’ve leaped.
Kurisu|Right. Of course.
Kurisu|If what you said is true, then I want to save Mayuri too.
Kurisu|But as the co-creator of the Time Leap Machine, I can’t recommend its continued use.
Kurisu|Will you listen to my advice?
Rintaro|I...
Rintaro|I need your help.
Rintaro|I have to save Mayuri! I can’t do it alone, but together, we might have a chance. I want... I need to believe that!
Rintaro|Please, lend me your strength.
Kurisu|You’re such a stubborn fool.
Kurisu|What you’ve been through... I’m surprised it hasn’t broken you already.
Kurisu|I’ll help.
Kurisu|Mayuri’s my friend, and a fellow lab mem.
Kurisu|And besides... I don’t want to see you in such pain.
Rintaro|I’m sorry.
Kurisu|Don’t apologize.
Kurisu|Remember when I told you about my father? You really helped me out back then.
Kurisu|Now it’s my turn to return the favor.
Kurisu|I want to be your strength.
Kurisu|Besides, you still have to come with me to Aomori.
Kurisu|I know you’re going to leap no matter what I say. You are a mad scientist, after all, and mad scientists play by their own rules.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|Hey. Aren’t you supposed to go ’muhahahaha’ or something?
Rintaro|Yeah...
Kurisu|Why do I even try?
Kurisu|Anyway, I’m not doing this for you, okay?
Kurisu|I’m doing it for Mayuri.
Rintaro|Yeah, of course.
Kurisu|That, and I think you’ll make a good test subject.
Rintaro|Now you’re talking like SERN.
Kurisu|It’s completely different.
Rintaro|How so?
Kurisu|I only experiment on you.
Kurisu|Besides, mad scientists experiment on themselves all the time, don’t they?
Rintaro|I guess...
Kurisu|I-it’s just a joke. Don’t take it so seriously.
Kurisu|There’s not much time. I think you should have a clear plan before trying to change the future again.
Rintaro|Meaning?
Kurisu|Leap to an even earlier time.
Kurisu|Then explain the situation to me again.
Kurisu|Let’s go.
Kurisu|I understand why you can’t tell Mayuri, but why can’t you tell Hashida?
Rintaro|I’ll tell him when it’s necessary.
Kurisu|They’ll throw you in the slammer for breaking and entering.
Rintaro|In a few seconds, it won’t have happened.
Kurisu|I see. That’s how it looks from your perspective.
Kurisu|What does it look like from my perspective? What happens here after you leap?
Rintaro|...You’ll know soon enough.
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|What’s wrong?
Kurisu|It’s nothing. I was just thinking.
Rintaro|Maybe it works like a D-Mail.
Kurisu|That would make things easier, though I kind of hope you’re wrong.
Rintaro|Because you can’t collect data if you can’t record the change?
Kurisu|Exactly.
Kurisu|I set the destination to five hours ago. You should arrive around 1:40 PM.
Kurisu|I completed the Time Leap Machine just after 2. Do you remember?
Kurisu|Nobody likes a man who can’t remember dates.
Kurisu|Be thankful that I make a habit of checking the time. I have a pretty good idea what happened when.
Kurisu|Listen, Okabe. If you’re going to keep using the Time Leap Machine, there’s one thing you must remember.
Kurisu|Don’t let go of your phone. Ever. It’s your lifeline. Your destination marker.
Kurisu|As long as you keep it with you, you can leap to any time you want.
Kurisu|But if you lose your phone... if someone else gets ahold of it...
Kurisu|If it breaks, or the battery dies...
Kurisu|The time leap will fail.
Kurisu|Once again, never let go of your phone.
Rintaro|Got it.
Kurisu|After you leap back to this afternoon, just sit tight and don’t do anything until I complete the Time Leap Machine.
Kurisu|If you accidentally prevent me from completing the machine, it will likely wreak havoc with the timeline.
Kurisu|As soon as I finish, declare that we will not experiment. Then send everyone home.
Kurisu|Ask me to stay. Tell me the truth. If you say you came from the future, I’ll probably believe you.
Rintaro|How do you know?
Kurisu|Who knows me better than myself?
Kurisu|Don’t forget. It was my mad skillz that turned the PhoneWave into a time leap machine.
Kurisu|When you told me about your time leap, I took it as proof that my theories were right. I was happy it succeeded. I really was. I didn’t doubt it was true for a second.
Kurisu|Just to be safe, I should probably give you a passphrase.
Kurisu|What I want the most right now is my own fork.
Rintaro|...What?
Kurisu|It doesn’t mean anything, okay!?
Rintaro|You want your own fork?
Kurisu|I already have my own spoon... wait, that doesn’t matter!
Kurisu|Everything’s ready! Now get out of here!
Kurisu|Be careful. And remember...
Kurisu|I’m always on your side.
Mayuri|Okarin, Okarin! Can you come here?
Mayuri|Can you hold this for me? Spread it out like ’fwapp!’
Itaru|Mayu-shi, say ’fwapp’ again.
Mayuri|Fwapp!
Itaru|I got a fwapp!
Kurisu|Stop it, perv.
Mayuri|Hmm...
Mayuri|Okay! Thanks.
Mayuri|All done♪
Mayuri|I finished before Chris-chan! We were racing.
Kurisu|You win, Mayuri. Congratulations.
Kurisu|But I’m finished too.
Kurisu|Complete.
Rintaro|We’re not experimenting.
Kurisu|Eh!?
Kurisu|I just finished and you’re already shutting it down? What I have been doing these past three days?
Rintaro|Time leaping presents a host of problems. I want to consider them all carefully.
Kurisu|H-huh. That’s... an unusually respectable opinion, coming from you.
Mayuri|Problems? I thought it was done?
Rintaro|I’ll explain later. Everyone’s tired, so let’s go home.
Itaru|We’re not going to have a party to celebrate?
Rintaro|We’ll do that another day.
Kurisu|What?
Rintaro|Are you upset?
Kurisu|...Yeah.
Rintaro|I came from five hours in the future.
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|Is that supposed to be funny?
Rintaro|D-don’t glare like that! This isn’t right! You’re supposed to believe me!
Kurisu|What made you think I’d believe something like that!?
Rintaro|You told me so! Five hours from now, okay!?
Kurisu|Don’t be ridiculous. I would never make such a baseless projection.
Rintaro|When I told you about my time leap, you said, ’I took it as proof that my theories were right. I didn’t doubt it was true for a second.’
Rintaro|’Don’t forget. It was my mad skillz that turned the PhoneWave into a time leap machine.’
Kurisu|I don’t talk like that!
Rintaro|What you want most right now is your own fork!
Kurisu|Wha--
Rintaro|You already have your own spoon, apparently.
Kurisu|S-she said that? I’m gonna kill myself five hours from now...
Kurisu|It feels like someone peeked into my heart. And that someone is Okabe, of all people.
Kurisu|But I think I believe you. Tell me the details.
Kurisu|I see... If what you say is true, then we have a serious problem.
Kurisu|Future me said that the chronology protection conjecture holds, but I don’t think that’s quite right.
Kurisu|That conjecture says that according to quantum theory, time travel is impossible due to the danger of disrupting causality.
Kurisu|But when you time leap, there’s no chance of a time paradox occurring.
Rintaro|So I was right.
Rintaro|The universe itself is censoring me, correcting any changes I try to make.
Kurisu|If that’s true, then time leaping can’t save Mayuri. Nothing you do will change the result.
Rintaro|...I can’t accept that.
Kurisu|Neither can I. The world is trying to kill Mayuri? As I scientist, I refuse to believe such nonsense.
Rintaro|What about the many-worlds interpretation? I just need to observe the world where Mayuri doesn’t die.
Kurisu|The many-worlds interpretation... That might have something to do with how Mayuri’s means of death keeps changing.
Kurisu|But it’s supposed to be impossible for parallel worlds to observe each other. Why are you different?
Rintaro|Because of my esper power, Reading Steiner.
Kurisu|This is no time for your chuunibyou nonsense.
Rintaro|...There’s no other explanation.
Kurisu|You’ve mentioned that Reading Steiner thing before. Were you actually serious?
Rintaro|Why would I make up something like that?
Kurisu|I don’t know, but I don’t want to rely on something that may not even exist.
Kurisu|Anyway, you can’t control which possibilities you observe. Even if the many-worlds interpretation holds true, it’s unreasonable to expect that you’ll ever find a world where Mayuri doesn’t die.
Rintaro|Wait. We’re not getting anywhere. Instead of analyzing what I’ve done, let’s think about what we can do.
Kurisu|Time leaping won’t change the result. I just said that.
Rintaro|Then what do we do!?
Kurisu|Calm down.
Rintaro|How can I calm down!? Do you know how many times I’ve seen Mayuri die!?
Rintaro|Covered in blood! Gasping for breath! The light fading from her eyes! Again... and again... and again...
Rintaro|And all I could do... was watch!
Kurisu|Getting emotional won’t solve anything.
Rintaro|You’re only calm because you weren’t there!
Kurisu|...True. I don’t know what happens five hours from now. To be honest, it doesn’t feel real at all.
Kurisu|But it’s not like I don’t believe you.
Kurisu|You have to stay strong, Okabe.
Rintaro|...Sorry.
Rintaro|What I don’t understand is how the cause can change but the effect can stay the same.
Rintaro|It’s like causality itself is broken.
Kurisu|Maybe Kiryu Moeka shooting her isn’t the real cause of her death. Maybe it’s something larger and less obvious.
Kurisu|For example, maybe she dies because we invented a time machine, or because SERN discovered our hacking.
Kurisu|If that’s the cause, then it doesn’t really matter how she dies. Causality remains intact.
Rintaro|Can that theory explain why Nae pushed her in front of a train?
Kurisu|Oh, right... hmm...
Kurisu|Anyway, the principle of causality is absolute. Deny that, and you deny all of physics.
Kurisu|There must be a distinct cause for Mayuri’s death.
Rintaro|So if we figure out what it is, then maybe we can save her.
Kurisu|Not necessarily.
Rintaro|What do you mean?
Kurisu|The problem is when the causal event occurred.
Kurisu|If it happened too far in the past... then there’s nothing we can do.
Rintaro|But I can travel to any time I had a cell phone, can’t I!?
Kurisu|No. It’s still theoretical, but I believe that one leap with our machine has a maximum range of 48 hours.
Rintaro|Why didn’t you tell me that before!?
Kurisu|Before what? I just finished the Time Leap Machine, remember?
Rintaro|Future you didn’t say anything about it either.
Kurisu|Oh, so that’s what you mean. Maybe she just didn’t have the chance.
Rintaro|So how come I can only leap 48 hours?
Kurisu|I don’t know. Even I don’t understand everything that’s going on inside that thing.
Kurisu|But you can do consecutive leaps. That is, as long as the Time Leap Machine exists. For example, if the Time Leap Machine remains functional for ten straight years, you could leap back to this moment ten years from now.
Kurisu|Of course, it would take a total of 1825 leaps, so I don’t recommend it. Still, it’s theoretically possible.
Rintaro|Then what’s the problem?
Kurisu|Weren’t you listening? I said, as long as the Time Leap Machine exists.
Kurisu|When was the machine completed?
Rintaro|...Ah.
Kurisu|Exactly. An hour ago. August 13th, 2010. 2:00 PM, or thereabouts.
Kurisu|It didn’t exist before then.
Kurisu|It’s impossible to use the machine before 2 PM today.
Rintaro|So what you’re saying is...
Rintaro|I can’t go back farther than 2 PM on the 11th!?
Kurisu|Most likely.
Rintaro|Can’t you improve it!?
Kurisu|Eventually, maybe, but certainly not now.
Kurisu|I’d need a real laboratory with real equipment. It would be expensive, which means we’d need sponsors.
Kurisu|And if we go looking, I’m pretty sure SERN would crush us.
Kurisu|I’d say that’s proven by the fact that neither you nor I have leapt here from the far future yet.
Rintaro|We can’t do anything!?
Rintaro|Even with the Time Leap Machine, we can’t stop SERN from killing Mayuri five hours from now!?
Rintaro|...Huh?
Rintaro|Hey!
Kurisu|Hey! Where are you going!?
Suzuha|...
Rintaro|Suzuha! I need to talk to you!
Suzuha|...I’m sorry. It’s all my fault.
Rintaro|...What?
Suzuha|All because I acted like a spoiled child.
Suzuha|This time, I’m going.
Suzuha|Bye.
Rintaro|Hey! Suzuha! Wait!
Rintaro|Wha...
Rintaro|Suzuha? Or could it be Moeka!?
Rintaro|So it is her!
Rintaro|Suzuha!!
Suzuha|Okabe Rintaro...
Suzuha|Ow!!
Rintaro|What are you doing!?
Suzuha|...It’s not working.
Rintaro|You know how to use that thing?
Suzuha|It’s not working...
Rintaro|Answer me, Amane Suzuha.
Rintaro|This is a time machine, isn’t it?
Rintaro|Are you a time traveler?
Suzuha|I’m...
Suzuha|John Titor.
Rintaro|What do you mean, you’re John Titor?
Suzuha|...Exactly what it sounds like.
Suzuha|I’m the John Titor who’s been posting on @channel.
Rintaro|...I thought he was a guy.
Suzuha|I fooled you? Guess my camouflage worked, then.
Rintaro|Who are you hiding from?
Suzuha|...SERN.
Rintaro|Those stories you posted... were they...
Suzuha|True? Mostly. A few exceptions.
Rintaro|So you came from 2036, and that satellite... that’s your time machine.
Suzuha|I was hoping you wouldn’t find out, but my time machine went and broke on me.
Suzuha|I really screwed up, huh?
Rintaro|I thought Titor’s time machine was loaded on a Chevy.
Suzuha|Chevy? That’s a car, right? Where’d you hear that?
Rintaro|The Titor in 2000 said so.
Suzuha|2000?
Suzuha|That might be me on a different worldline.
Suzuha|At least, I haven’t been to 2000. I came straight here from 2036.
Rintaro|What do you know?
Rintaro|You overheard my conversation with Kurisu, right? Why did you run to the time machine? What were you trying to do?
Suzuha|I thought it was my fault.
Rintaro|What?
Suzuha|Because I neglected my mission, SERN was able to put their plan in motion.
Suzuha|...Is it true!?
Suzuha|Is it true that SERN kills Shiina Mayuri?
Rintaro|It’s true. I time leaped from five hours in the future.
Suzuha|Time leaped...
Suzuha|So you guys completed your time machine...
Rintaro|I need answers! What do you mean it’s your fault!?
Suzuha|...
Suzuha|I’ll tell you everything.
Suzuha|I think you need to know. You... and Makise Kurisu.
Suzuha|...Thanks.
Mayuri|Welcome back, Okarin! Oh! Suzu-san’s with you too♪
Mayuri|I really thought we should celebrate the birth of Super PhoneWave-chan!
Mayuri|So Daru-kun and I went shopping♪
Kurisu|W-what do we do?
Rintaro|Make absolutely sure Mayuri doesn’t find out.
Itaru|What are you guys whispering about?
Kurisu|Um...
Rintaro|How many times do I have to say it? No party!
Mayuri|Come on, Okarin. That’s no fun!
Rintaro|It’s not about fun.
Mayuri|Suzu-san? Are you feeling okay?
Rintaro|Suzuha, Christina, and I have important matters to discuss. That’s why I asked you to leave for the day.
Mayuri|Mayushii wants to hear too!
Itaru|Um, I think he’s serious.
Mayuri|But Suzu-san looks sad... Mayushii’s worried...
Suzuha|...Sorry.
Suzuha|I want Shiina Mayuri and Hashida Itaru to stay. This concerns them too.
Rintaro|...
Itaru|A girl from the future? That’s awesome! Can I shake your hand?
Rintaro|We’re not playing around here, Daru.
Mayuri|What year were you born?
Suzuha|2017.
Mayuri|That’s in seven years... You haven’t been born yet, but you’re here. Uh... huh???
Rintaro|Alright, Suzuha. Let’s hear it.
Suzuha|Well, the gist is what I posted on @channel.
Suzuha|I came from future, the year 2036. In my time, the world is a dystopia ruled by SERN. There’s no war, no conflict, but no freedom either.
Mayuri|Diss-tope-ear?
Kurisu|A society where every activity is controlled by the government. In a dystopia, you’re not allowed to eat bananas unless today is banana-eating day. If you break that rule, they throw you in jail without a trial.
Mayuri|That’s terrible! Mayushii loves bananas...
Suzuha|I’m part of the Resistance fighting to free humanity from SERN’s control.
Suzuha|I came to the past to change my present.
Suzuha|From your point of view, I guess I should say the future. To change the future.
Mayuri|Um, what about finding your father? Was that a lie?
Suzuha|...
Kurisu|SERN is a research institution. They don’t have political power. I explained that to John Titor several times online.
Rintaro|...Wait, don’t tell me. You’re ’KuriGohan and Kamehameha’!?
Kurisu|Titor came forward, so it’s only fair that I do too.
Rintaro|In that case, I’ll come clean too. I was posting under my true name, Hououin Kyou--
Kurisu & Suzuha|I know.
Mayuri|Ah, you harmonized♪
Suzuha|SERN is still a research institution in 2036.
Suzuha|The world is actually ruled by SERN’s secret backers, the Committee of 300.
Rintaro|The Committee of 300... They’re real?
Suzuha|When SERN successfully completed their time machine, they became the sole entity with power over the fourth dimension, Time.
Suzuha|In just two years, they remade the world to serve their purpose.
Suzuha|That brings us to you, Makise Kurisu.
Suzuha|In 2036, you’re apotheosized as the mother of the time machine.
Kurisu|Apotheosized?
Itaru|In Japanese, please.
Suzuha|Apotheosized. As in revered, respected.
Kurisu|Respected? Huh!? I-I am!?
Suzuha|In 2010, you pioneer time leap technology. Afterwards, you contribute to the development of SERN’s time machine. That’s what I know about Makise Kurisu.
Rintaro|Then I must be the father of the time machine, right?
Suzuha|Okabe Rintaro is a terrorist in 2036. You’re pretty infamous.
Rintaro|Wha...
Kurisu|I help SERN build their time machine? I don’t believe it.
Kurisu|SERN experiments on people against their will. They’re a disgrace to scientists everywhere. I would never collaborate with them.
Suzuha|But that’s how it is in the future.
Kurisu|How did the future me explain herself?
Suzuha|We’ve never met. By 2036, you’re already dead... sorry.
Kurisu|Well... that’s just great.
Kurisu|I don’t even make it to fifty?
Suzuha|In my time, there are two kinds of people: those who live extremely long lives, and those who die young, under suspicious circumstances.
Suzuha|People who act against SERN are erased.
Kurisu|T-they erased me?
Suzuha|...Maybe you were being used by SERN too. Maybe they took your parents hostage and forced you to work on their time machine.
Kurisu|No... does that mean Mama’s in danger?
Rintaro|Rounders.
Itaru|What’s that?
Rintaro|SERN’s private army. Or something like that.
Suzuha|On paper, they’re an independent technology research firm. In reality, they do the dirty work for SERN all over the world.
Suzuha|So they already exist. I thought they might. In my time, they’re our number one enemy.
Itaru|D-dirty work? Does that mean like... kidnappings and assassinations?
Suzuha|...
Suzuha|In my time, yes. But I don’t think they’ve reached that level in this time yet.
Kurisu|Amane-san. You said that most of what you posted as John Titor was true, right?
Suzuha|Right.
Kurisu|Does that mean you know how the universe works? You claimed that the Everett-Wheeler model -- the many-worlds interpretation -- is correct.
Suzuha|That was a lie. Camouflage so that SERN wouldn’t target me.
Suzuha|If I mix one lie into the truth, then the bad apple spoils the barrel.
Kurisu|So you don’t know.
Suzuha|I do. By 2036, scientists have successfully modeled the structure of the universe. And it’s not the many-worlds interpretation.
Kurisu|Really? Tell me!
Rintaro|Attractor Fields...
Suzuha|Right. I told you by mail, didn’t I?
Kurisu|What sort of model is that?
Suzuha|The universe is made up of worldlines and attractor fields.
Suzuha|The universe is like this piece of yarn.
Suzuha|Countless possible worldlines exist side by side, branching out to infinity.
Suzuha|From a distance, it looks like a single string, but when you look closer, the string is actually made up of individual threads woven together.
Suzuha|At the end, those threads converge on a single point. The paths are different, but the destination is the same.
Kurisu|Isn’t that determinism?
Suzuha|Close. This model is a little looser.
Suzuha|You could say it cherry-picks from the many-worlds interpretation and the Copenhagen interpretation.
Rintaro|If the branches all lead to the same place, does that mean there’s only one world in the end?
Suzuha|Exactly.
Suzuha|The bundle of worldlines that share a point of convergence is called an attractor field.
Suzuha|There are also many attractor fields.
Suzuha|This string is Attractor Field Alpha. The threads are Alpha worldlines.
Suzuha|Blue is Beta, yellow is Gamma, and white is Delta.
Suzuha|Each is made up of countless Beta worldlines, Gamma worldlines, or Delta worldlines.
Suzuha|Attractor fields are superpositioned like this.
Suzuha|In each attractor field, the worldlines converge on a different result.
Suzuha|They don’t interact. Each attractor field is independent of the others.
Suzuha|Of course, they all diverged from a common point somewhere in the past, and they will all converge again at some point in the future, but that takes many hundreds of years.
Suzuha|You can think of the attractor fields as very long worldlines.
Itaru|Can you compare it to an eroge? Teach me, oh erotic one.
Kurisu|T-there’s no erotic one here!
Rintaro|No, he’s right. It is like an eroge. Each heroine’s route is an attractor field, and the small choices within are the individual worldlines.
Rintaro|But at the end, they all enter the true route for the grand ending.
Itaru|The only difference is the length of the common parts. By the way, I’d choose the little sister’s attractor field.
Rintaro|Whatever.
Kurisu|You guys are hopeless. Better do something quick.
Suzuha|Umm, I don’t know what you guys are talking about...
Kurisu|Just ignore them.
Itaru|But then, isn’t it impossible to change the future? It always converges in the end, right? No matter what you do, the result is the same.
Suzuha|We have to escape Attractor Field Alpha.
Rintaro|Escape?
Suzuha|In other words, we’re going to jump to a worldline in Attractor Field Beta.
Kurisu|I thought attractor fields couldn’t interact.
Suzuha|Attractor fields are normally separate, but if we go to the instant they diverge...
Kurisu|The instant they diverge... is that now?
Suzuha|I was taught that a major divergence occurs in 2010.
Suzuha|This year, an earth-shattering event causes divergence at the attractor field level. The last time such a divergence occurred was in the year 2000, and before that, in 1991.
Mayuri|Umm, what happened those years?
Suzuha|Events that changed the face of the world.
Mayuri|Huh?
Rintaro|1991 was the collapse of the Soviet Union, right? But what happened in 2000? 2001 had the 9/11 attacks...
Suzuha|The Year 2000 Problem.
Itaru|Y2K? But that was just hype. Nothing happened.
Suzuha|That’s because the Alpha worldline we’re on represents a world where Y2K didn’t occur.
Suzuha|And that brings us to 2010.
Mayuri|Did something big happen this year?
Suzuha|What else could it be...
Suzuha|But the creation of humanity’s first time machine?
Mayuri|Oh yeah! Wow!
Kurisu|One more question.
Kurisu|These worldlines aren’t parallel worlds, are they?
Suzuha|No. Ultimately, they’re just possibilities that exist simultaneously.
Kurisu|Then how do you observe the differences between worldlines? Wouldn’t you need a god’s eye view to do that?
Suzuha|Normally. However...
Rintaro|Reading Steiner!?
Suzuha|Is that what you call it? Okabe Rintaro, you have the power to observe changes across worldlines. Correct?
Rintaro|Yeah.
Suzuha|That’s the key.
Suzuha|Your power is the key to freeing the world from SERN’s rule.
Suzuha|You have the power of a god.
Rintaro|My power...
Suzuha|If you escape Attractor Field Alpha and reach a Beta worldline... then the result will change.
Rintaro|So there’s hope?
Kurisu|Wait a second.
Kurisu|How do we know this is all true? What if Amane-san is just making stuff up?
Suzuha|What!? I’m not making stuff up!
Kurisu|Calm down. I’m not trying to pick a fight.
Kurisu|But I still have questions. One, how do you know about Okabe’s power? Two, how did you know Okabe and I were in Akihabara in 2010?
Kurisu|Don’t you know a little too much for someone born in 2017?
Suzuha|...It was written in Dad’s will.
Mayuri|What do you mean?
Suzuha|His will was what made me decide to time travel.
Suzuha|My dad was one of the founding members of the Resistance. He hid from SERN and researched time travel on his own.
Suzuha|He wanted to change the future.
Suzuha|But SERN killed him.
Suzuha|That’s why I’m here. To fulfill his dream.
Kurisu|...I’m sorry.
Suzuha|...
Suzuha|Akihabara, 2010. The time machine created here accelerates SERN’s own time machine research.
Suzuha|We have to stop that from happening in order to guide history in a new direction.
Itaru|Stop it? How?
Rintaro|SERN already knows about us.
Suzuha|Dad believed that the ultimate cause was the very first email you sent with your time machine.
Rintaro|An email? It wasn’t because they caught us hacking?
Itaru|Like I said, nobody can catch my hacking.
Kurisu|Which email are you talking about?
Mayuri|Um, I know! Wasn’t it the email Okarin sent that said Chris-chan died?
Kurisu|Oh, that...
Suzuha|SERN probably intercepted that email and realized what it meant.
Rintaro|They were already on to us back then?
Itaru|We really jumped in the deep end, huh...
Mayuri|Mayushii’s good at the breaststroke!
Itaru|Alright, then do a sexy underwater pose.
Rintaro|But how did they intercept our email? Hundreds of millions of emails are sent around the world each day.
Suzuha|SERN uses the Echelon network to collect communications pertaining to time travel research worldwide.
Rintaro|Echelon!? It really exists!?
Suzuha|Echelon sees everything. Any transmission that even hints at time travel is filtered and sent to SERN.
Suzuha|We need to find the record of that email in SERN’s database and delete it.
Suzuha|If you do that, then SERN will never know you exist. Their time machine won’t be completed in 2034. If we’re lucky, the program may be shut down entirely.
Itaru|Hmm... there wasn’t any data like that when we hacked SERN’s database.
Suzuha|The IBN 5100.
Itaru|Oh!
Rintaro|Of course! SERN’s IBN 5100 database!
Suzuha|That’s probably where they store the data from Echelon.
Rintaro|Dammit, Daru! Why didn’t we use the IBN 5100 earlier!?
Itaru|Uh... we never had one?
Rintaro|What are you talking about!? I got one, remember!?
Itaru|Huh?
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|My mission is to make sure you acquire an IBN 5100.
Rintaro|You have one!?
Suzuha|I’m going to 1975 to obtain one.
Rintaro|Alright! We need to move fast. How soon can you leave, Suzuha?
Suzuha|I was trying to leave when you caught me, but...
Rintaro|Right... your time machine’s broken.
Kurisu|Can you fix it?
Suzuha|No. I just ride it. My dad’s the one who built it.
Suzuha|I’ve memorized the manual, so I know how it works, but...
Kurisu|Maybe we can use the Time Leap Machine to go back before Amane-san’s time machine broke.
Itaru|Wait, you’re going to use the Time Leap Machine? Wasn’t the plan not to experiment?
Rintaro|We’ll use it if the situation demands. Do you know when it broke, Suzuha?
Suzuha|No... but it was probably the rain a few days ago. It’s supposed to be airtight, but the inside was all wet when I checked it today.
Itaru|Maybe it made a hole when you crashed into Radi-Kan?
Suzuha|That wasn’t a crash. The coordinates were slightly off, so it just appeared there.
Suzuha|It’s not exactly the most stable machine.
Rintaro|Anyone remember when it rained?
Kurisu|The morning of the 10th. Just before dawn.
Rintaro|Damn! We can’t get there with the Time Leap Machine!
Itaru|I think we should try to fix it.
Mayuri|Yeah! It’s a time machine, so we have plenty of time, right?
Suzuha|...
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|You’re all hungry, aren’t you? You should be.
Itaru|What’s this all of a sudden?
Mayuri|Mayushii’s hungry!
Rintaro|Mayuri, Daru. I leave the shopping to you. We can come up with a plan while we eat.
Mayuri|Wow, Okarin! What are we going to do with all this money?
Rintaro|Buy food. Lots of food. Use it all!
Itaru|You just calmly hand over a 10,000 yen bill... wow, Okarin, you make it look easy! That’s why we love you! That’s why we admire you!
Rintaro|Christina. Titor.
Suzuha|Titor? Is that me?
Rintaro|Who else?
Suzuha|Why are you calling me that now?
Rintaro|Because you’re the one behind Titor’s mask.
Suzuha|Well, yeah, but...
Kurisu|Just give up. Okabe rarely calls anyone by their name.
Suzuha|Oh yeah. He always calls me ’Part-Time Warrior’ for some reason.
Rintaro|Listen, you two. I’m going to leap to 2 PM on the 11th.
Rintaro|After Titor explains herself again, we’ll start repairs on the time machine. Our goal is to have it working by this time today.
Kurisu|Is that the best plan?
Rintaro|It’s better than trying to fix it when we only have two hours left. If it doesn’t work, I’ll just keep repeating the same two days.
Suzuha|...I’m sorry.
Rintaro|Titor. We’re counting on you to get us an IBN 5100.
Rintaro|Never forget. I’m not doing this for you, and I’m not doing it for the future. My mission is to save Mayuri.
Rintaro|Call me self-righteous if you want. However...
Rintaro|I’m doing this my way.
Rintaro|Good. Then let’s begin.
Kurisu|You’re not going to name the operation?
Kurisu|You couldn’t find a good Norse mythology-themed name?
Suzuha|Why Norse mythology?
Kurisu|I don’t think there’s a deep meaning behind it. Chuunibyou patients just love Germanic names for some reason.
Suzuha|Now that you mention it, most of our operation names in the Resistance have Germanic names too. Whenever I ask, they say it’s tradition.
Kurisu|So there’s still chuunibyou in 2036...
Rintaro|Cut the chatter!
Itaru|Let’s go take a look!
Mayuri|H-hold on, everyone!
Mayuri|Um, guys? Aren’t we forgetting something?
Itaru|Like what?
Mayuri|What about Suzu-san’s dad?
Suzuha|...That doesn’t matter now, does it?
Mayuri|It does too! I mean, it’ll take time to fix the time machine, won’t it? We should help Suzu-san find her dad in the meantime!
Mayuri|Right?
Rintaro|But...
Mayuri|Don’t be like that, Okarin! You have to keep your promise.
Mayuri|We promised, remember? We said we’d all look for Suzu-san’s dad.
Rintaro|Yeah... I remember.
Mayuri|I know Suzu-san has a mission and stuff, but I think she also came because she really wanted to meet her dad.
Mayuri|Mayushii wants to make that happen!
Suzuha|Shiina Mayuri... you’re such a nice girl...
Suzuha|...You’re right.
Suzuha|I thought I could find him if I came to this town.
Suzuha|I know that he was in Akihabara in 2010.
Rintaro|So your father’s real!?
Suzuha|Of course he is! At this age, he’s probably still young and cool.
Rintaro|His name was Barrel Titor, right?
Suzuha|Yeah, that’s right.
Mayuri|Wow, a foreigner?
Suzuha|No, I’m pretty sure he’s Japanese. Barrel Titor is his codename in the Resistance. I don’t think he’s using it yet.
Suzuha|I... don’t know his real name.
Suzuha|Some daughter, huh?
Suzuha|He died before he could tell me.
Rintaro|What about your surname, Amane?
Suzuha|That was my mother’s maiden name.
Kurisu|So you have no leads?
Suzuha|Leads... oh, there is one thing.
Mayuri|A pin?
Mayuri|There’s something written on it.
Suzuha|This belonged to my dad.
Kurisu|A memento...
Rintaro|Google it, Daru!
Suzuha|He was here in Akihabara, so I think we can exclude the foreign sites.
Itaru|Okay, got it.
Itaru|Nothing!
Mayuri|But this has to be some kind of hint!
Mayuri|Okay, all in favor of helping Suzu-san find her dad?
Rintaro|...No objections.
Mayuri|Thanks, Okarin♪ Ehehe!
Suzuha|Everyone... thank you.
Suzuha|But I want to be clear that my mission to 1975 comes first. That was my dad’s final wish, after all.
Suzuha|So if we still haven’t found him by the time repairs are complete, I think we should give up. Is that okay?
Mayuri|Are you sure?
Suzuha|If we still haven’t found him by then, it just wasn’t meant to be.
Itaru|So where do we start?
Rintaro|The pin is our only hint. We’ll hit every store in Akiba that sells things like this. Maybe someone will know where it came from.
Suzuha|What kind of stores?
Rintaro|Akiba is full of niche stores where you can find strange and cool accessories.
Rintaro|How does it look?
Itaru|It’s so freaking hot in there.
Itaru|It’s worse than a sauna. Spend too much time in there and I’ll turn into Daru jerky.
Itaru|By the way, it’s not gonna fall or anything... right?
Suzuha|Can it be fixed?
Itaru|Well, I still don’t know for sure. But there is one thing I noticed just now.
Itaru|It’s built kind of like the PhoneWave.
Rintaro|That means there’s a chance, right!?
Itaru|I said I’m not sure. I need to poke around some more.
Rintaro|Daru. Super Hacka. Everything depends on your skills now.
Rintaro|You are the super hacka who will save the world. In 2036, people will worship you instead of Kurisu, the mother of the time machine.
Itaru|It’s hacker! How many times do I have to tell you!?
Rintaro|Anyway, you have two days. Do whatever it takes, Daru.
Rintaro|You’re our only hope.
Itaru|No promises, man. And why two days?
Rintaro|Well...
Suzuha|In two days, the weather conditions will be perfect for creating the ring singularity.
Suzuha|If we miss that window, we won’t have another chance until next year.
Rintaro|P-precisely!
Itaru|Fix it in two days? That’s just nuts.
Rintaro|But if you do, you’ll earn the right to a date with Faris.
Itaru|...!?
Rintaro|Can you fix it?
Itaru|No problem!
Kurisu|Welcome back.
Kurisu|From the looks on your faces, I guess you didn’t find anything.
Rintaro|Where’s Daru?
Kurisu|He hasn’t come back yet. It’s already dark, so maybe he went straight home?
Suzuha|I feel bad. There’s no time for this...
Rintaro|It’s not for you. We’re doing it to save Mayuri.
Suzuha|...Yeah.
Rintaro|Is it SERN!?
Kurisu|Good morning.
Rintaro|...You came to wake me up? Thanks.
Kurisu|I didn’t do it for you.
Suzuha|I asked her to wake you up, Okabe Rintaro. There’s something I want to show you.
Rintaro|...What’s this?
Suzuha|A divergence meter. The numbers indicate the divergence value of the current worldline.
Suzuha|Divergence is measured from my original worldline, which corresponds to zero.
Rintaro|You made this?
Suzuha|No. I brought it with me from 2036.
Rintaro|These are Nixie tubes, right? Whoever made this has taste. I’d happily dub it Future Gadget No. 9.
Kurisu|How exactly does it work? It shouldn’t be possible to measure changes like that.
Suzuha|I don’t know either.
Rintaro|You don’t know!?
Suzuha|Can you guess who made it?
Suzuha|You did, Okabe Rintaro.
Rintaro|Huh?
Suzuha|You made it, umm... 11 years from now. It apparently works the same way your special power does.
Rintaro|Huh...
Kurisu|So this meter lets other people check worldline divergence?
Suzuha|I wish.
Suzuha|I’m pretty sure only Okabe Rintaro would notice if the number changed.
Kurisu|What? Then there’s no point. Make something useful for once, Okabe.
Suzuha|Only the person who made it knows how it works. Wait 11 years. I’m sure he’ll have figured it out by then.
Rintaro|Have you met me in the future?
Suzuha|...No. Never.
Rintaro|Oh...
Rintaro|So, why are you showing me this?
Suzuha|When the meter reads over 1%, you’ve made it to the Beta worldline.
Rintaro|1%...
Suzuha|Right. Reach 1% divergence... and you’ll save Shiina Mayuri.
Suzuha|You can have it. No point in me carrying it around. I hope you’ll find a use for it.
Rintaro|HEY, MASTER. I AM MAD SCIENTIST. SO COOOOL. SONUVABITCH!
Master|Can I help you?
Rintaro|Um, I have a question, if you don’t mind.
Rintaro|Does this look familiar?
Rintaro|I want to know where it came from. Can you help me find out?
Master|Ee... remember... remember? Hmmm, sorry, itsa little diff-cult, eh...
Master|By the way, where’d ya get this thang?
Rintaro|That’s what I want to know. I’ll compensate you.
Master|I sorry.
Suzuha|Okabe Rintaro.
Suzuha|’Sup. Want a drink?
Rintaro|Anything?
Suzuha|Nope.
Suzuha|So what was with your English back there?
Suzuha|It sounded dumb. ’So cooool.’
Suzuha|Is that standard English in this era?
Rintaro|Of course not.
Suzuha|Oh, so it’s an Okabe Rintaro original. There’s no overseas travel in my time, so I wouldn’t know.
Rintaro|No overseas travel? What, you mean at all?
Suzuha|Pretty much. Travel permits are hard to get, and they’d never issue one for a vacation. I’d never seen a foreigner before coming to this time.
Rintaro|...Maybe this pin is newer than we think. I mean, maybe it hasn’t been made yet.
Suzuha|Maybe I’m not meant to meet him. I mean, we’ve tried everything and still no sign. It’s just not in the cards, I guess.
Rintaro|How can you give up? We still have one more day!
Suzuha|W-why are you getting mad?
Rintaro|Everyone’s fighting for you. Don’t you get it!?
Rintaro|Me? I want to prioritize Mayuri over everything else!
Rintaro|But you’re still a lab mem, a friend! When a friend’s in trouble, you want to help them. That’s how Mayuri felt, and I agree. That’s why I’m searching!
Rintaro|So how dare you be the first to give up!?
Suzuha|Y-you don’t have to yell!
Rintaro|Don’t disappoint me like this!
Suzuha|I’m sorry. But maybe you should think about how I feel.
Rintaro|...You’re right. I shouldn’t have said that.
Suzuha|...
Rintaro|...Alright. What next?
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Mayushii here.
Rintaro|Where are you now?
Mayuri|Umm, in front of the station.
Rintaro|Let’s meet up. Stay right there.
Mayuri|Okay!
Mayuri|Please take one! We need your help!
Rintaro|What is she doing?
Mayuri|There’s been a kidnapping! The kidnapper was wearing this pin! Please help us find him!
Mayuri|Okarin, Suzu-san! Um, there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask.
Mayuri|The ’Barrel’ in Suzuha’s dad’s name. What does it mean?
Rintaro|It’s just a name. It probably doesn’t mean anything.
Mayuri|But it’s not his real name, right?
Suzuha|Right. It’s a codename.
Mayuri|So why did he choose Barrel Titor? And why did you choose John, Suzu-san?
Suzuha|Because John’s the most common English name.
Mayuri|But Barrel isn’t common.
Suzuha|Now that you mention it.
Mayuri|Well, whatcha think? I think it’s a masterpiece!
Rintaro|What’s this kidnapping stuff about?
Mayuri|It was my idea. I’m sure it’ll make everyone want to help!
Mayuri|It’s a good strategy, dontcha think? Umm, the operation name is ’Mayushii’s Awesome Leaflet Plan’.
Suzuha|Um... isn’t this going a little too far?
???|You three.
Rintaro|!?
Policeman|What are these leaflets about? Let’s talk at the station.
Mayuri|Ehh?
Kurisu|Hey, Okabe, remember the lifter? I don’t suppose you’ve figured out what it is... no, of course you haven’t.
Rintaro|I already know. It’s the 42-inch CRT downstairs.
Kurisu|R-really? What’s your proof?
Rintaro|I’ve been here before, remember?
Kurisu|...Oh, right. The CRT... I see...
Mayuri|I’m sorry, guys. I made things worse...
Kurisu|Hello.
Rintaro|Assistant? It’s me.
Kurisu|Oh, I think you got the wrong number.
Rintaro|What are you saying? It’s me, Hououin Kyouma.
Kurisu|My name isn’t Assistant. And your name isn’t Hououin Kyouma.
Rintaro|Would you prefer to be called ’KuriGohan and Kamehameha’?
Kurisu|Bwah!?
Kurisu|How do you know about that!?
Rintaro|Before I time leaped, you made a tearful confession. You said, ’I’m an @channeler, a Nicojunkie, and a camwhore who posts tits, but will you still accept me as your assistant?’
Rintaro|And I, of course, replied...
Rintaro|’You may be an @channeler, a Nicojunkie, and a camwhore who posts tits, but you’re still a member of this lab.
Rintaro|And that makes you my assistant, now and forever. So wipe your tears, for there is still much--’
Kurisu|I’m gonna post your personal info all over VIP if you don’t shut your mouth right this second!
Rintaro|...How are things there?
Kurisu|Fine. You called at the right time. We need to talk.
Rintaro|I’ll be right there.
Kurisu|OK. I’ll be waiting.
Kurisu|For your information, I don’t post t...ti...
Kurisu|I don’t post pictures of my chest, okay!?
Rintaro|It was just a joke. Let it die.
Kurisu|...
Suzuha|Kurigohan and Kamehameha... so you’re the one who kept picking fights with me on the internet. Makes sense.
Kurisu|I thought you wanted an open discussion.
Suzuha|Sure. You were kind of annoying, though.
Kurisu|Hehehe...
Suzuha|Ahaha!
Rintaro|By the way, it may shock you to learn that I am the poster known as Hououin Kyou--
Kurisu & Suzuha|I know.
Rintaro|So, what did you want to talk about? The Time Leap Machine?
Kurisu|I think you probably forgot, so I wanted to make sure just in case.
Kurisu|Have you been looking for the lifter? You haven’t, have you?
Rintaro|I already know. It’s the 42-inch CRT downstairs.
Kurisu|R-really? What’s your proof?
Rintaro|I’ve been here before, remember?
Kurisu|I see...
Rintaro|...Sorry for sticking you with this job.
Kurisu|What? Don’t apologize. It’s creepy.
Rintaro|I know you’re not a fan of time travel research. But here you are building a time machine.
Rintaro|I was just worried that maybe you were feeling conflicted.
Kurisu|How rude.
Kurisu|I’m sure I’ve said this before, but I’ve always accepted time travel as a theory.
Kurisu|I just don’t trust people who claim it can be done despite how unrealistic it is.
Kurisu|Besides, I can hardly deny it with evidence staring me in the face.
Kurisu|Though I still don’t like the idea of being called the mother of the time machine.
Kurisu|Anyway. If you’re apologizing, that must mean you helped out the first time.
Rintaro|The first time?
Kurisu|Before you started time leaping. You helped me build the machine, didn’t you?
Rintaro|Yeah. Daru and I helped.
Kurisu|Then don’t worry about it. I wouldn’t want you to have to do it all over again.
Kurisu|And right now, it’s more important to repair Amane-san’s time machine and search for her father.
Suzuha|...Sorry.
Kurisu|Don’t you apologize now. It’s weird.
Kurisu|Welp, back to work. I should be able to get a lot done now that I know about the lifter.
Itaru|Hoihoi.
Rintaro|It’s me. Report.
Itaru|You know, it’s distracting as hell when you talk like that.
Rintaro|Enough about you. Report the status of the repairs.
Itaru|I’m turning into a prune here!
Rintaro|...
Itaru|Hey, at least give me some reaction.
Itaru|Anyway, I think I figured out what it needs.
Rintaro|Really!?
Itaru|Pretty much.
Rintaro|Should I bring reinforcements?
Itaru|Mm, yeah, I guess. Bring Amane-shi with you if you can.
Itaru|Alone in the heat of the vacant Radi-Kan rooftop, the two of us can forget our shame and take off our clothes. Haah haah...
Rintaro|I hope we find your dried-up bones.
Itaru|Gonna have to disappoint you there. How about you? Did you find out anything about the pin?
Rintaro|No. It’s an uphill battle.
Itaru|Not even a clue?
Rintaro|No...
Itaru|Damn, that sucks.
Rintaro|I’m going to hit up a few more places. I’ll head over there in the evening.
Rintaro|By the way...
Rintaro|Am I really famous in 2036?
Suzuha|As a terrorist.
Rintaro|Oh.
Rintaro|So what did I do to be called a terrorist?
Suzuha|You rebelled against SERN. You’re actually one of the founding members of the Resistance. Just like my dad.
Rintaro|How stupid...
Suzuha|Stupid?
Rintaro|How can I still be chasing some chuunibyou fantasy... when I couldn’t even save Mayuri?
Suzuha|You’re fighting to free humanity. I think it’s a noble cause.
Rintaro|What sort of man am I?
Suzuha|...I said we never met, remember?
Rintaro|Never?
Suzuha|Never. You were... killed by SERN. In 2025.
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|Maybe I should have told you sooner.
Suzuha|Understand? If you don’t change the future, you’re going to die in 15 years.
Suzuha|Shiina Mayuri will die. You will die. Makise Kurisu will be a slave to SERN. It ends badly for every lab mem.
Rintaro|What about Daru?
Suzuha|Umm, I don’t remember hearing about him. I have heard legends of a ’wizard-class hacker,’ though.
Suzuha|Though I don’t understand what ’wizard-class’ means in the first place.
Suzuha|Anyway, I don’t want that to happen to you guys.
Suzuha|That’s one more reason I need to find an IBN 5100 and change the future.
Suzuha|Until I came to this time, you guys were just stories, history. But now... you’re my friends.
Suzuha|I want to save you.
Rintaro|...Appreciated.
Rintaro|You are a lab mem, now and forevermore.
Suzuha|Ahaha! Thanks.
Itaru|You’re supposed to give me an ice cold zero calorie cola. Common sense, man...
Mayuri|Hey, Okarin. Isn’t it amazing that the satellite was a time machine?
Rintaro|Yeah, I guess so.
Mayuri|I’m glad Suzu-san wasn’t hurt in the crash.
Mayuri|I heard it’s really hard to drive.
Mayuri|If the gravitational whatchamacallit coordinates are just a teensy bit off, the whole time machine becomes a jellyman and goes ploop.
Mayuri|And she even said her time machine’s unstable, since it’s not a SERN model.
Mayuri|I’m worried about her trip to 1975...
Mayuri|Do you think I should go with her? I wonder if I’d fit.
Rintaro|What would you do in 1975?
Mayuri|I’d cheer Suzu-san on, of course! I’d hold her hand super tight, and tell her that everything’s going to be okay!
Mayuri|Hey, Okarin, do you think the time machine has a name?
Rintaro|A name...
Rintaro|If you want to know, just ask Titor.
Mayuri|Oh, yeah! Mayushii didn’t think of that. Ehehe!
Mayuri|Yup. It has a name.
Rintaro|What is it?
Mayuri|FG204 something something, she said.
Mayuri|Anyway, don’t you think Daru-kun and Suzu-san are a good match?
Rintaro|Huh?
Rintaro|How do you figure? Daru’s all about Faris, you know.
Mayuri|Oh... really?
Rintaro|Oh yeah, Mayuri. What happened to your costumes?
Mayuri|Hm? I already made two costumes. One for Kaede-chan and one for Fubuki-chan.
Rintaro|Weren’t you making a third one for Lukako?
Mayuri|Yeah, I was. But I couldn’t convince her, so I gave up this time.
Mayuri|Hey, can Mayushii take a closer look at the time machine?
Rintaro|Just don’t get in their way.
Mayuri|Okeydokey♪
Suzuha|Hashida Itaru’s amazing. He said if things go well, he could have the time machine fixed by tomorrow.
Rintaro|He’s a man who gets things done.
Suzuha|And he looks so unhealthy and slow.
Rintaro|Don’t judge a book by its cover.
Suzuha|Yeah. I have a better impression of him now.
Suzuha|Umm... hey.
Suzuha|There’s something I want to say, and I feel like I’ll never get another chance.
Rintaro|Why so melodramatic?
Suzuha|I’m really grateful to you. All of you.
Suzuha|When I came to this time, I didn’t know anyone. I was all alone in a world completely different from my own.
Suzuha|This era is so peaceful. That’s a wonderful thing... but it scared me. All I knew was the fight against SERN.
Suzuha|But now I have friends... real friends, who I can share my secrets with.
Suzuha|All these people who lived before I was born are working so hard for my sake.
Suzuha|It’s a strange feeling... but a happy one, too.
Suzuha|I wanted you to know that.
Suzuha|Living with you guys in this time... it’s been really fun.
Suzuha|When I met you, you were all so strange and unique and over the top... I was kind of shocked at first, actually.
Suzuha|But before I knew it, I started to enjoy spending time with you.
Suzuha|2036 is peaceful too. People don’t even fight anymore. Did you know that?
Rintaro|How could I? I’m not even alive in 2036, right?
Suzuha|Oh... right. Sorry.
Suzuha|Anyway, people don’t fight. Ever. About anything. All forms of conflict, war included, have vanished -- poof -- without a trace.
Suzuha|Instead, everyone has dead eyes, like fish.
Suzuha|No one has ambition. Nobody dreams. They just trudge through their lives without a single complaint.
Suzuha|Oh sure, people smile. But they never get angry or sad.
Suzuha|There’s no individuality. Everyone’s a robot.
Suzuha|You got really mad at me before, remember?
Suzuha|I was really surprised. But at the same time... I was really happy.
Rintaro|You’re a strange girl.
Suzuha|Ahaha. I guess so.
Suzuha|You’re all so bright and full of life. I envy you.
Suzuha|Shiina Mayuri, Hashida Itaru... even Makise Kurisu. And of course, you.
Rintaro|...Don’t be ridiculous.
Suzuha|I want to be more like you.
Rintaro|If you ask me, you’re the amazing one.
Suzuha|I’m... happy to hear you say that.
Suzuha|It’s thanks to all of you that I’m still going strong.
Suzuha|Being a lab mem, even for just a little while... was great.
Suzuha|Being with you guys, even for just a little while... was great.
Rintaro|...Suzuha?
Suzuha|Change the future, Okabe Rintaro. Make it a world like this one, where people can be free.
Rintaro|Hey, come on. Why are you being so sentimental?
Rintaro|After we fix the time machine, let’s have a party.
Suzuha|...Thanks.
Rintaro|It’s me.
???|Hi, Mistah Okabe Rintaro?
Rintaro|SERN!?
???|SERN? What is dat?
Rintaro|Identify yourself.
???|You, one more afternoon, came to our factory make inquiry and told me your telephone number you know?
Rintaro|What are you saying?
Rintaro|Identified. NICE TO MEET YOU.
Master|Oh! You’re welcome.
Master|I do custom work. Yesterday night, a guest come here I remembered!
Master|That guest was please make pin badge same one you had!
Rintaro|I’ll head there right now!
Master|Oh! Okaabee! Hello!
Rintaro|Where did that guest of yours go!?
Master|Client come here was yesterday time.
Rintaro|What’s his contact info? His name and address!?
Master|Poison. Guest just for simulation. Private information have nothing.
Master|Japanese, very studious and awarding private information, become nervous and serious, yes?
Master|If guest had gave name or telephone number however, no leak. That is business.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|What did your customer look like? Man? Woman?
Master|Well... So young. Or so middle. Japanese have young face. Just by look no understand.
Rintaro|Anything else?
Master|Um?
Master|Maybe a judo fighter? Or, pro wrestler?
Rintaro|What? Judo? Pro wrestler? What do you mean by that?
Master|YES!
Master|Ahh, balloon. Was balloon!
Rintaro|Balloon? Judo? Pro wrestling?
Master|Good!
Kurisu|Done.
Suzuha|So that’s the Time Leap Machine...
Suzuha|It makes you remember the future, right? That’s pretty interesting.
Suzuha|Intuition... sixth sense... deja vu...
Suzuha|I wonder if those things are actually you recalling future memories.
Suzuha|Some of SERN’s researchers in my time came up with the theory that memories are a way of sharing information across worldlines.
Suzuha|Maybe it’s similar to that.
Kurisu|I just wish we knew more about Okabe’s Reading Steiner thing.
Kurisu|Is it unique to Okabe? Or does everyone have the potential for it, and Okabe’s is just stronger by coincidence?
Rintaro|One thing’s for certain. My consciousness leaps to the past along with my memories.
Kurisu|I still don’t understand why that is. It would make more sense if you experienced a change in the present, like you do when we send a D-Mail.
Kurisu|Does your consciousness depend on your memories?
Suzuha|The problem is that consciousness doesn’t have a form that we can see.
Suzuha|Same goes for the soul. Those things are still in the realm of religion.
Suzuha|Even in 2036, the existence of the soul hasn’t been proven, and nobody’s proven what forms consciousness, either.
Kurisu|I see... that’s a little disappointing.
Rintaro|Sending my consciousness back has let me change some future events with more precision than D-Mail, but other events are locked in by convergence.
Suzuha|That’s not how it works.
Suzuha|The future is always determined.
Rintaro|Then why does the path there change?
Suzuha|Because the worldline changes.
Suzuha|When you leap into the past and take different actions from before, divergence changes, if only a little bit.
Suzuha|In most cases, that fluctuation won’t amount to more than 0.000001% on the divergence meter.
Suzuha|Small changes might not register at all.
Suzuha|When you change the cause, the effect merely shifts to a separate, already-existing worldline.
Suzuha|Since those two worldlines are almost exactly the same, you barely feel any difference.
Suzuha|It’s not like the previous worldline disappears. It keeps existing as another possible worldline.
Kurisu|That’s the many-worlds interpretation, right?
Suzuha|In any case, they’re not parallel worlds.
Rintaro|So is the future reconstructed?
Suzuha|I guess you could say that.
Rintaro|Is that...!?
Rintaro|Daru!
Itaru|Okarin!?
Rintaro|What are you doing here!?
Itaru|I was gonna ask the same question.
Rintaro|Alright, Daru. What were you doing at that street stand? Don’t tell me you were trying to counterfeit duplicates of Titor’s pin.
Itaru|...F-fine. I won’t tell you then.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Could he have been more confusing!?
Rintaro|So why were you trying to make counterfeit versions of the pin?
Itaru|Uh, I wasn’t trying to counterfeit it.
Rintaro|Close enough.
Itaru|Well... I meant it as a backup plan, I guess.
Itaru|Amane-shi’s gonna be sad if we don’t find her old man, right?
Itaru|So if that happens, I’ll show her the badges I made and, well, lie that her dad was here...
Rintaro|So you’ll give her false hope.
Itaru|You don’t have to put it like that. Remember, there are good lies and bad lies: bad lies hurt people, good lies save them!
Rintaro|What eroge did you get that from?
Itaru|CLADDAN... and it’s not an eroge, it’s a visual novel that teaches you the meaning of life, so shut up!
Itaru|So... should I call off Operation Fake Titor?
Rintaro|Do you really think that will make Suzuha happy?
Itaru|Amane-shi told me not to tell anyone, but...
Itaru|I guess I’d better tell you.
Itaru|I heard this from Amane-shi when we were discussing the repairs.
Itaru|Her time machine... can only leap to the past.
Rintaro|...What?
Rintaro|Nonsense. Titor’s time machine could travel both ways.
Itaru|Did you actually see it?
Rintaro|Well, no...
Itaru|Besides, when you say Titor, you mean the one who appeared in 2000, don’t you? I don’t know anything about that Titor.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|So... wait.
Itaru|Once she leaves, she can’t come back.
Rintaro|You’re saying that if she goes to 1975, she can’t return to 2010?
Itaru|Not without living 35 years in real time.
Rintaro|Does that mean Suzuha’s time machine can never return to 2036?
Itaru|Didn’t I just say that?
Rintaro|Then it’s defective!
Itaru|Right. She said the time machine was incomplete.
Itaru|According to Amane-shi, her old man built it in secret by reverse-engineering SERN technology.
Itaru|But SERN killed him before he could complete it. Amane-shi insists that it’s fine as long as she can leap to the past, but...
Rintaro|Are you sure about this?
Itaru|She said so herself. I don’t think she was lying.
Rintaro|...
Itaru|So if she doesn’t meet her old man before the time machine is repaired...
Itaru|She might never get another chance.
Rintaro|But making a fake version of her father’s pin isn’t going to solve anything. A lie is a lie.
Itaru|But if we don’t get caught...
Itaru|Wow, Okarin! An ice cold zero calorie cola! How thoughtful of you!
Mayuri|Hey, Okarin. Isn’t it amazing that the satellite was a time machine?
Rintaro|Yeah, I guess so.
Mayuri|I’m glad Suzu-san wasn’t hurt in the crash.
Mayuri|I heard it’s really hard to drive.
Mayuri|If the gravitational whatchamacallit coordinates are just a teensy bit off, the whole time machine becomes a jellyman and goes ploop.
Mayuri|And she even said her time machine’s unstable, since it’s not a SERN model.
Mayuri|I’m worried about her trip to 1975...
Mayuri|Do you think I should go with her? I wonder if I’d fit.
Rintaro|What would you do in 1975?
Mayuri|I’d cheer Suzu-san on, of course! I’d hold her hand super tight, and tell her that everything’s going to be okay!
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Hey, Okarin, do you think the time machine has a name?
Rintaro|If you want to know, just ask Titor.
Mayuri|Oh, yeah! Mayushii didn’t think of that. Ehehe!
Mayuri|Yup. It has a name.
Mayuri|FG204 something something, she said.
Mayuri|Anyway, don’t you think Daru-kun and Suzu-san are a good match?
Rintaro|Daru’s all about Faris.
Mayuri|Oh... really?
Mayuri|Hey, can Mayushii take a closer look at the time machine?
Suzuha|Hashida Itaru’s amazing. He said if things go well, he could have the time machine fixed by tomorrow.
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|And he looks so unhealthy and slow.
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|Umm... hey.
Suzuha|There’s something I want to say, and I feel like I’ll never get another chance.
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|Are you listening?
Suzuha|I’m really grateful to you. All of you.
Suzuha|When I came to this time, I didn’t know anyone. I was all alone in a world completely different from my own.
Suzuha|This era is so peaceful. That’s a wonderful thing... but it scared me. All I knew was the fight against SERN.
Suzuha|But now I have friends... real friends, who I can share my secrets with.
Suzuha|All these people who lived before I was born are working so hard for my sake.
Suzuha|It’s a strange feeling... but a happy one, too.
Suzuha|I wanted you to know that.
Itaru|Her time machine can only leap to the past.
Suzuha|Living with you guys in this time... it’s been really fun.
Suzuha|When I met you, you were all so strange and unique and over the top... I was kind of shocked at first, actually.
Suzuha|But before I knew it, I started to enjoy spending time with you.
Suzuha|2036 is peaceful too. People don’t even fight anymore. Did you know that?
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|Anyway, people don’t fight. Ever. About anything. All forms of conflict, war included, have vanished -- poof -- without a trace.
Suzuha|Instead, everyone has dead eyes, like fish.
Suzuha|No one has ambition. Nobody dreams. They just trudge through their lives without a single complaint.
Suzuha|Oh sure, people smile. But they never get angry or sad.
Suzuha|There’s no individuality. Everyone’s a robot.
Suzuha|You got really mad at me before, remember?
Suzuha|I was really surprised. But at the same time... I was really happy.
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|You’re all so bright and full of life. I envy you.
Suzuha|Shiina Mayuri, Hashida Itaru... even Makise Kurisu. And of course, you.
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|I want to be more like you.
Suzuha|It’s thanks to all of you that I’m still going strong.
Suzuha|Being a lab mem, even for just a little while... was great.
Suzuha|Being with you guys, even for just a little while... was great.
Suzuha|Change the future, Okabe Rintaro. Make it a world like this one, where people can be free.
Rintaro|Do you...
Suzuha|Hm?
Rintaro|Do you regret spending time with us?
Suzuha|...What do you mean?
Rintaro|Do you regret making new friends here? New memories? Do you wish you had kept your distance?
Rintaro|You’ve already abandoned one life. Now you have to abandon another.
Rintaro|In a sense... it’s like you’re killing yourself.
Suzuha|...Did Hashida Itaru tell you?
Rintaro|He’s worried about you.
Suzuha|Geez. I told him not to tell anybody.
Rintaro|Well? How do you feel about going to 1975?
Suzuha|...It doesn’t matter how I feel.
Suzuha|I have to go. It’s the path I chose, and it’s what my dad wanted.
Rintaro|What if we ask you to stay?
Suzuha|I’ll go anyway.
Suzuha|One of those guys on @channel asked what right I have to change the future and decide the fate of the human race. He had a point.
Suzuha|But still... I don’t want the future to turn out like that.
Suzuha|I want the people in my time to be free like you. Free to laugh and play, fight and argue, get sad and cry.
Suzuha|If I change the future, then no one will die. Not you, not Shiina Mayuri, and not my dad.
Suzuha|Maybe I don’t have the right... but I’m going anyway.
Rintaro|Even if you can never return?
Suzuha|Aw, come on! The 70s aren’t a bad time, you know? I’ll find friends there just like you guys. We’ll have a blast!
Suzuha|Thanks, guys... really. I can’t thank you enough.
Mayuri|Don’t forget about us!
Itaru|If you want to thank me, then let’s make out.
Kurisu|Control yourself, perv.
Suzuha|Oh right. Take this.
Suzuha|This is for you, Okabe Rintaro. Keep it in the lab, will you? Somewhere out of sight is fine.
Rintaro|Suzuha...
Itaru|Um... about the pin.
Itaru|Why don’t we make duplicates for all the lab mems? Make it our symbol, I guess.
Mayuri|Wow! That’s a great idea!
Kurisu|How unusually thoughtful of you.
Suzuha|Ahaha. I... I don’t know what to say.
Itaru|We already took a picture of it, so keep your pin, Amane-shi. It belonged to your dad, right?
Suzuha|Yeah... okay.
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Okay everyone! Dahdahdahdah! Mayushii has an important announcement to make!
Mayuri|Actually... Mayushii found Suzu-san’s dad!
Rintaro|Huh?
Suzuha|What!?
Itaru|Really!?
Mayuri|Wanna meet him? You do, dontcha? Well, he’s here with us today!
Suzuha|W-where?
Mayuri|Allow me to introduce you! Suzu-san’s dad is...
Mayuri|Drrrrrrrrrrrr...
Itaru|Is that a drum roll!?
Mayuri|Tada! Suzu-san’s dad is...
Mayuri|Daru-kun!
Kurisu|That joke’s not even logical. It’s impossible for this perv to get married in the first place.
Itaru|Hey... that kind of hurts.
Rintaro|I completely agree with Christina. Daru is fated to become a wizard when he turns thirty.
Itaru|You could be nicer about it, guys... but it’s the truth, so I can’t object.
Suzuha|Um... you know... my dad wasn’t fat.
Mayuri|Geez. You’re all so mean to Daru-kun.
Itaru|Mayu-shi’s the only one to stand up for me. You’re an angel, Mayu-shi. Do you love me?
Mayuri|Nope.
Mayuri|Um, Mayushii’s one hundred millon percent sure that Daru-kun is Suzuha’s dad.
Kurisu|Okay. What’s your proof?
Mayuri|Um, I was thinking about the letters on Suzu-san’s pin...
Mayuri|After staring at it really hard, I noticed the 7 in ’7010’ looked a little weird.
Mayuri|It’s not a 7, it’s a 2. The line fell off the bottom.
Suzuha|R-really?
Suzuha|It’s so small, I can’t tell...
Mayuri|It’s easy to see on the picture we took!
Kurisu|2010? But that’s this year!
Rintaro|Then what do the letters mean?
Mayuri|That’s easy!
Mayuri|Okabe, Shiina, Hashida, Makise. And finally, Amane.
Itaru|Wha...
Itaru|It’s our initials!?
Mayuri|So I was thinking, why 2010? And then I remembered it’s the year of the lab mems.
Mayuri|The Future Gadget Laboratory was founded this year.
Suzuha|So that’s what it is...
Mayuri|And you know, Suzu-san has lots of stories about future Okarin and future Chris-chan, but not a single story about Daru-kun, right?
Itaru|There weren’t any about Mayu-shi either.
Mayuri|Well, Mayushii’s a lab mem, but I can’t make time machines, and I don’t like fighting. Of course I’m not famous!
Mayuri|But Daru-kun’s a super hacka and Okarin’s right arm. He even helped Okarin make PhoneWave-chan. So I thought it was strange Suzu-san didn’t know him.
Kurisu|So you’re saying he used a different name?
Mayuri|Barrel Titor-san helped Okarin found the Resistance, right?
Mayuri|And he was in Akiba in 2010.
Mayuri|And he was able to build his own time machine.
Mayuri|And he knew about Okarin’s Reading Spaghetti--
Rintaro|Reading Steiner.
Mayuri|He knew about it.
Mayuri|Doesn’t that fit Daru-kun perfectly?
Kurisu|She’s right.
Mayuri|Do you remember the day Suzu-san went to meet her father?
Mayuri|She thought he would be at the time machine offline meet.
Mayuri|Daru-kun was supposed to be there too, right?
Itaru|That meet was seriously important to the history of Japanese SciFi. At least I got to sneak in while tailing Amane-shi.
Suzuha|Dad told me about that meet when I was little. I don’t remember what he said exactly, but I thought I might be able to meet him there.
Itaru|So if I’d been at the meet, everything would’ve been okay?
Suzuha|Hmm, I don’t know. I don’t think I’d have picked you out as my dad.
Mayuri|And then there’s the time machine’s name, FG204 something something... umm, what was it?
Suzuha|FG204 2nd EDITION ver. 2.31.
Rintaro|Th-that naming sense... it’s got to be Daru!
Mayuri|And FG probably stands for Future Gadget.
Mayuri|Finally, his name. Barrel Titor has to be Daru-kun!
Kurisu|Come to think of it, last night, Mayuri asked how to say ’barrel’ in Japanese.
Mayuri|Barrel is ’taru’ in Japanese. Right, Chris-chan?
Rintaro|Taru... Taru... Daru!?
Suzuha|It’s a pun!?
Mayuri|Okay, Suzu-san! Say ’Hashida Itaru’ ten times fast!
Suzuha|Wh-why?
Mayuri|Just say it and find out! Ehehe!
Suzuha|HashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaru
Mayuri|Just now, didn’t it sound like ’Ditor’?
Kurisu|It did.
Mayuri|Hashidaitaru. Hashi-daita-ru. Hashi-Ditor-ru. Hashi-Titor-ru.
Itaru|...For reals?
Mayuri|For super reals♪
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|I think she looks just like her father♪
Kurisu|That could just be the placebo effect... but now that you mention it, they kinda do look alike.
Rintaro|Nice work, Mayuri! You’ll make a great detective one day.
Mayuri|A d-detective? Ehehe! That’s the first time anyone’s said that.
Itaru|My... d-daughter? Amane-shi is my daughter?
Suzuha|Dad...
Itaru|Uh... c-c-could you call me Papa instead?
Kurisu|For once in your life, don’t be a perv...
Suzuha|Dad...!
Itaru|...
Suzuha|I came, Dad. I came to see you... in the time machine you built.
Itaru|Yeah...
Suzuha|I’m going to finish what you started. I promise.
Itaru|Yeah...
Suzuha|Watch over me. Okay?
Itaru|I’m watching. Of course I am!
Itaru|B-by the way, was your mother cute? Request petite girl with cute face and big boobs.
Suzuha|Ahaha. That’s a secret.
Suzuha|Well! That takes care of everything I wanted to do on this worldline.
Suzuha|Guess I should be going.
Rintaro|W-wait! You’re going already? Don’t you have more to say to your father?
Suzuha|No, I’m fine now. I’m going to get an IBN 5100, just like I promised.
Suzuha|I’ll bring it to you here in Akihabara. That’s my duty, and I’ll see it through. The rest is up to you.
Suzuha|Change the future. Please.
Suzuha|Well, see you in 35 years... though I guess it’ll only be a few hours for you guys. Ahaha!
Suzuha|Oh, I almost forgot. The time machine gives off terrific ultraviolet rays when it jumps, so make sure not to look directly at it.
Rintaro|Suzuha...
Itaru|S-Suzuha!!
Itaru|I’m sure we’ll meet again!
Itaru|I’ll do my best until then! I hate myself for not knowing any other way to say it, but I’ll do my best!
Itaru|I’ll do my best, I promise! So Suzuha, do your best too!
Kurisu|Haah, whew... whew... no more... running...
Itaru|Suzuha’s 54 by now, right?
Itaru|My daughter is 30 years older than me. I don’t know if I want to see that. Feels weird, man.
Kurisu|You know, it wouldn’t be unusual for her to have grandchildren by that age.
Itaru|Y-you mean I could have great-grandkids? I don’t know if I’m ready for that, man...
Mayuri|Just be super nice to them! That’s what grandpas do!
Itaru|Please, don’t call me grandpa...
Tennouji|Okabe!
Rintaro|Oh, it’s you...
Tennouji|Hey, have you seen my part-timer?
Mayuri|If you’re looking for Suzu-san, she went 35 years--
Kurisu|Shaddup, Mayuri!
Tennouji|You know something? Where’d that girl run off to?
Tennouji|She took the last couple days off and I don’t know when she’s coming next. She won’t even answer her phone.
Rintaro|She said she went back to her hometown. She’s probably gone for good.
Tennouji|What!? You sure?
Tennouji|That brat. She didn’t say a word to me.
Tennouji|Well, whatever. I’ve got something for you, Okabe.
Rintaro|...For me?
Rintaro|What is this?
Tennouji|It’s from the lady who used to own this building. She asked me to give it to you on this day.
Rintaro|Uh... who?
Tennouji|How did you know Suzu-san anyway?
Rintaro|Where is she now!?
Tennouji|Huh? Uh, she passed away ten years ago.
Rintaro|Passed away!?
Rintaro|...How old was she?
Tennouji|Mid-forties, I think.
Rintaro|Thank you for taking care of this letter, Mister Braun.
Mayuri|Eh? Eh? Is it from Suzu-san?
Itaru|Seriously? Why did he have it?
Suzuha|Dear Okabe Rintaro,
Suzuha|It’s me, Amane Suzuha. Hashida Titor’s daughter. It’s been a long time.
Suzuha|Though for you, I’m sure only a few hours have passed.
Suzuha|The date is June 13th, the year 2000.
Suzuha|Meaning I’m writing this ten years before you will read it.
Suzuha|I’ll get right to the point.
Suzuha|I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed
Suzuha|I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed
Suzuha|The date is June 14th, the year 2000.
Suzuha|About nine or ten years before you will read this.
Suzuha|I failed.
Suzuha|I only remembered who I was one year ago today.
Suzuha|The day Nostradamus said the King of Terror would come.
Suzuha|Stupid, stupid, King of Terror. He should have come and burned us all away.
Suzuha|For 24 years, I forgot who I was.
Suzuha|All I could remember was my name.
Suzuha|I finally remembered one year ago.
Suzuha|The day the King of Terror was supposed to come but didn’t.
Suzuha|There’s no King of Terror, but I want to die.
Suzuha|The repairs were incomplete. The time machine malfunctioned. When I arrived in 1975, I couldn’t remember anything.
Suzuha|They found me lying in the street like a broken doll and took me to a hospital.
Suzuha|Now I’ve been living on my own for years, but that’s as Hashida Suzu, a normal person who forgot the duty and mission of Amane Suzuha I only remembered last year.
Suzuha|I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed
Suzuha|Something went wrong! I don’t know what. The repairs were incomplete. But it’s not Dad’s fault, it’s mine.
Suzuha|I should have gone straight to 1975. I shouldn’t have stopped in 2010, but I was selfish and now the future is doomed.
Suzuha|There’s no IBN 5100.
Suzuha|I’m sorry.
Suzuha|I’m so sorry.
Suzuha|For what purpose have I lived to this age?
Suzuha|I forgot my duty and lived a carefree life instead.
Suzuha|Now my life has no meaning at all.
Suzuha|It’s worthless. Worthless. Worthless.
Suzuha|I wish I hadn’t remembered.
Suzuha|I’m glad I finally remembered.
Suzuha|I’m glad I had this chance to say sorry.
Suzuha|Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me, forgive me!
Suzuha|My plan failed.
Suzuha|I spent this whole year asking myself why.
Suzuha|I finally figured it out.
Suzuha|If I hadn’t postponed my leap to 1975, this wouldn’t have happened.
Suzuha|Okabe Rintaro.
Suzuha|After the offline meet, you stopped me from going to 1975.
Suzuha|I was really happy, but that’s where it all went wrong.
Suzuha|I should have left. I shouldn’t have waited. That was my last chance.
Suzuha|That night, there was a thunderstorm. My time machine was flooded.
Suzuha|If you can go back to that day, please, please, let me leave.
Suzuha|Then, I can bring you the IBN 5100.
Suzuha|I can fulfill my mission.
Suzuha|Please. That’s all I want.
Suzuha|I promised Dad.
Suzuha|This was his dream.
Suzuha|I want to change the future.
Suzuha|I’m sorry.
Suzuha|I’m sorry.
Suzuha|I’m sorry.
Suzuha|My life was meaningless.
Rintaro|Daru... didn’t you fix the time machine?
Itaru|I... I did... I thought I did... but I mean, that was my first time repairing a time machine. I might have missed something.
Rintaro|Missed something!? Whatever you missed cost your daughter 24 years of her life!
Itaru|I didn’t do it on purpose!
Kurisu|Calm down, both of you. Hashida did everything he could. He doesn’t deserve your anger, Okabe.
Rintaro|How can you be so calm!?
Kurisu|That’s how I am. Sorry. Now calm down.
Rintaro|Gh...
Rintaro|Mister Braun!
Tennouji|Okabe! Did you hear? That satellite up and disappeared. Everyone’s talking about it.
Rintaro|Please... I need to know.
Tennouji|Huh? Know what?
Rintaro|Hashida Suzu-san... how did she die?
Tennouji|...Why do you wanna know that?
Rintaro|I... don’t know anything about how she died.
Rintaro|I need to know what her last moments were like. I feel... that it’s my duty to know. To engrave her memory into my heart.
Tennouji|...Sounds like you’ve got a reason.
Tennouji|What I want to know is how you knew her.
Rintaro|She was... an old acquaintance.
Rintaro|A very old acquaintance... but I still remember the time I spent with her.
Rintaro|So please... tell me.
Tennouji|I don’t like to talk about it... but alright. Listen good, Okabe.
Tennouji|It was suicide.
Tennouji|She hung herself at home. I was the one who found her.
Tennouji|She became unstable about a year before it happened. Before that, she was a nice, cheerful lady.
Tennouji|This building was hers. She gave me a place to stay.
Tennouji|She had no relatives, you know. Almost no one came to her funeral. It was a sad thing to see.
Tennouji|She handed me that letter a week before it happened. Told me to give it to a young man named Okabe Rintaro on this exact date.
Tennouji|When you moved in upstairs, I thought Suzu-san must’ve seen the future or something.
Mayuri|Okarin, are you okay?
Kurisu|What are you doing, Okabe!?
Rintaro|We can’t just leave it like this! I have to do something!
Kurisu|Okabe...
Mayuri|But Okarin, are you sure?
Rintaro|Kurisu. You’re good at remembering dates, aren’t you?
Kurisu|Huh? Well, sure...
Rintaro|When did we throw that party for Suzuha?
Kurisu|Four days ago. August 9th.
Mayuri|You’re sending a D-Mail, Okarin? But won’t that make everything disappear?
Mayuri|Are you sure!?
Mayuri|Our memories with Suzu-san will disappear! Is that really okay?
Suzuha|Being with you guys, even for just a little while... was great.
Suzuha|I’m going to finish what you started, Dad. I promise.
Suzuha|Well, see you in 35 years... though I guess it’ll only be a few hours for you guys. Ahaha!
Suzuha|Change the future. Please.
Kurisu|Do you have a plan?
Rintaro|...ah.
Kurisu|...see? You’re shaking. We’ve only been at it for two days and you’re already exhausted.
Kurisu|We still have plenty of time to find the pin. You don’t have to be in such a hurry.
Kurisu|If you collapse, what then? I won’t be worried about you, but Mayuri sure will.
Kurisu|Take care of yourself. Got it?
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Yeah... got it.
Mayuri|The weather’s so nice!
Itaru|Whew, hee, why did I have to come along?
Kurisu|Same... here... haah, whew... the wind’s... too strong...
Mayuri|You’re a little chubby, Daru-kun. I think you need to exercise more!
Itaru|Fat neckbeard master race...
Suzuha|What a view!
Suzuha|I thought this trip would be a waste of time at first, but I guess people need to take a break once in a while!
Kurisu|I’d rather... be working... on the time leap machine...
Itaru|This... just proves... that I belong... indoors...
Mayuri|You two are all worn out! Ehehe!
Suzuha|Come on, guys! Stamina is the key to survival!
Itaru|W-water! Where’s a vending machine!? I could kill for a glass of water!
Rintaro|Sorry, but there’s no convenience store until we cross another bridge after this one. Tough it out.
Itaru|Y-you serious? I can’t, it’s impossible...
Mayuri|Wow, Okarin. You really know the area. Have you been here before?
Rintaro|...Yeah. Many times.
Rintaro|Big Sight’s straight ahead. It shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes to get there.
Itaru|Let’s take a break first...
Rintaro|It’s not safe there. Come on.
Itaru|Let me rest!
Rintaro|I said it’s not safe.
Itaru|Okay, okay!
Itaru|Th-that was close!
Itaru|You saved me, Okarin...
Mayuri|You know, that was almost like Okarin saw the future!
Kurisu|You got a D-Mail, didn’t you?
Suzuha|...
Itaru|Holy Land, I have returned!
Mayuri|Wow... I’ve never seen it this empty...
Kurisu|Look at all that space. It’s hard to believe they fill this whole area during ComiMa.
Mayuri|Hey! Mayushii’s hungry!
Itaru|Isn’t there a restaurant nearby? Let’s take a break.
Kurisu|I can’t believe we have to bike all the way back. What a nightmare...
Rintaro|What’s wrong, Suzuha?
Suzuha|I’m excited to see Big Sight in real life.
Suzuha|It’s gone by 2036, you know.
Suzuha|They cleared it to make way for bigger, better convention centers. Tokyo’s full of them in my time. They even moved the Dome out there.
Suzuha|Hashida Itaru called it the Holy Land. Is that how you see it in this time?
Suzuha|So this is where they have ComiMa... I’ve heard of it. Hundreds of thousands of people come, right? Mom said that’s where she met my dad.
Rintaro|Ahh, so your mother was a fujoshi.
Suzuha|I’ve always wanted to see this place. Thank you, Okabe Rintaro.
Suzuha|I feel... closer to my dad now.
Mayuri|Okarin! Suzu-san! Come on, come on!
Suzuha|That’s us. Come on! I’m starving.
Mayuri|The weather’s so nice!
Itaru|Whew, hee, why did I have to come along?
Kurisu|Same... here... haah, whew... the wind’s... too strong...
Mayuri|You’re a little chubby, Daru-kun. I think you need to exercise more!
Itaru|Fat neckbeard master race...
Suzuha|What a view!
Suzuha|I thought this trip would be a waste of time at first, but I guess people need to take a break once in a while!
Kurisu|I’d rather... be working... on the time leap machine...
Itaru|This... just proves... that I belong... indoors...
Mayuri|You two are all worn out! Ehehe!
Suzuha|Come on, guys! Stamina is the key to survival!
Itaru|W-water! Where’s a vending machine!? I could kill for a glass of water!
Rintaro|Sorry, but there’s no convenience store until we cross another bridge after this one. Tough it out.
Itaru|Y-you serious? I can’t, it’s impossible...
Mayuri|Wow, Okarin! You really know the area! Have you been here before?
Rintaro|...Yeah. Many times.
Rintaro|Big Sight’s straight ahead. It shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes to get there.
Itaru|Let’s take a break first...
Rintaro|It’s not sa--
Itaru|Whoa!
Itaru|Th-that was close!
Kurisu|Hey, are you okay?
Suzuha|Are you hurt?
Mayuri|That truck was mean!
Itaru|Man, what a shock. What was with that guy!? Crazy drivers. I should’ve checked the number! Then I could be like ’Reported!’
Kurisu|Nothing actually happened, so there’s not much point in reporting it.
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|...Okabe Rintaro?
Rintaro|!?
Suzuha|...You look pale.
Itaru|What’s wrong, Okarin? I’m the one who should be shaking!
Rintaro|R-right...
Rintaro|I was just imagining what would happen if I lost my super hacka. The lab can’t survive without you!
Rintaro|Break’s over! Let’s go!
Itaru|Holy Land, I have returned!
Mayuri|Wow... I’ve never seen it this empty...
Kurisu|Look at all that space. It’s hard to believe they fill this whole area during ComiMa.
Mayuri|Hey! Mayushii’s hungry!
Itaru|Isn’t there a restaurant nearby? Let’s take a break.
Kurisu|I can’t believe we have to bike all the way back. What a nightmare...
Rintaro|Gah...
Suzuha|...Okabe Rintaro?
Suzuha|You really are sick, aren’t you? Want to sit down?
Suzuha|Okabe Rintaro! Where are you going!?
Rintaro|...Still?
Mayuri|The weather’s so nice!
Itaru|Whew, hee, why did I have to come along?
Kurisu|Same... here... haah, whew... the wind’s... too strong...
Mayuri|You’re a little chubby, Daru-kun. I think you need to exercise more!
Itaru|Fat neckbeard master race...
Suzuha|What a view!
Suzuha|I thought this trip would be a waste of time at first, but I guess people need to take a break once in a while, huh?
Kurisu|I’d rather... be working... on the time leap machine...
Itaru|This... just proves... that I belong... indoors...
Mayuri|You two are all worn out! Ehehe!
Suzuha|Come on, guys! Stamina is the key to survival!
Itaru|W-water! Where’s a vending machine!? I could kill for a glass of water!
Rintaro|...Then do it.
Itaru|Huh?
Rintaro|Do it. Kill someone.
Itaru|W-why so serious, man?
Rintaro|Come on, what are you waiting for? If you want to do it, then do it.
Kurisu|Hey, Okabe. What’s gotten into you?
Mayuri|Okarin, you shouldn’t say things like that.
Suzuha|...
Itaru|What’s up with you, man?
Rintaro|Nothing.
Rintaro|There’s a convenience store once we pass two bridges. Tough it out.
Itaru|Geh, really? That’s farther than I thought...
Suzuha|...
Itaru|Haah... I quit cycling!
Itaru|Whoa!
Itaru|Th-that was close!
Kurisu|Hey, are you okay?
Suzuha|Are you hurt?
Mayuri|That truck was mean!
Itaru|Man, what a shock. What was with that guy!? Crazy drivers. I should’ve checked the number! Then I could be like ’Reported!’
Rintaro|So report him.
Rintaro|There, now you know. Report him.
Itaru|...Did I do something, Okarin?
Rintaro|You said you wanted to report him, so I’m giving you the opportunity.
Kurisu|I agree that Hashida could be a little less lazy, but you’re going way too far, Okabe.
Rintaro|Shut up, you class rep wannabe.
Kurisu|Wh, what?
Mayuri|No fighting, guys! Daru-kun’s okay, so let’s be happy, okay?
Rintaro|You’re not going to report him?
Itaru|W-well, I guess I’ll let him off the hook this time.
Suzuha|...
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|...
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|Hey. Wasn’t there a movie about a guy who gets trapped in some kind of time loop?
Suzuha|Groundhog Day, right? It was like a hundred years old when I saw it.
Suzuha|The movies in my time are all boring. SERN propaganda, you know? So we watch old movies instead.
Suzuha|Like Groundhog Day.
Rintaro|Never heard of it.
Suzuha|It was pretty unsatisfying.
Suzuha|I mean, the loop ends without the hero really doing anything. Like, he becomes a good person and suddenly, happy ending.
Suzuha|Kinda dumb.
Suzuha|You’re trapped in a loop too, aren’t you? All of us are.
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|Say something, Okabe Rintaro.
Suzuha|You’ve been here before, haven’t you?
Rintaro|What... what are you talking about?
Suzuha|I saw Big Sight for the first time today. But this isn’t the first time I’ve seen it.
Rintaro|Word games?
Suzuha|We’ve come here before, haven’t we?
Suzuha|You’ve experienced today multiple times, haven’t you?
Suzuha|How many times?
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|Answer me!
Suzuha|You have the eyes of a dead man.
Suzuha|I know those eyes. They’re everywhere you look in my time!
Suzuha|Look at me, Okabe Rintaro! Don’t kill your soul!
Suzuha|Makise Kurisu’s soon to be completed time leap machine. You’ve been using it to repeat the past, haven’t you!?
Rintaro|What if I have?
Suzuha|Why are you doing this!?
Rintaro|...Who knows. The reason no longer matters.
Suzuha|What are you running from?
Rintaro|Running? Yeah... I’m running.
Rintaro|Running from Mayuri’s death.
Suzuha|That’s why I’m going to 1975. I’ll bring you the IBN 5100, and then you can--
Rintaro|No. You fail.
Suzuha|What!?
Rintaro|And then, after 25 lonely, meaningless years, you hang yourself.
Suzuha|What? But...
Rintaro|That’s why I’m hiding in this loop. So that neither you nor Mayuri will die.
Rintaro|As long as I repeat these two days, nothing changes. Nobody dies.
Rintaro|I’ve accepted that duty. To keep everyone alive. 
Suzuha|That’s only from your perspective!
Suzuha|The world continues into the future independent of you! No matter how many thousands of loops you make, Shiina Mayuri will still die.
Suzuha|It’s not a solution!
Rintaro|Yeah...
Rintaro|But I’m not looking for a solution.
Suzuha|Do you intend to keep looping forever?
Rintaro|Yes. I’ve accepted that duty.
Suzuha|You haven’t accepted anything! Can’t you see how it’s twisted you?
Rintaro|No matter what happens to me, this world will continue. The loop will continue. No matter what happens, the loop will not end.
Suzuha|How long can you endure living frozen in time?
Suzuha|You can’t keep this up forever, you know?
Suzuha|Your body may never die. But look at yourself, Okabe Rintaro. Your soul is already hanging by a thread.
Rintaro|But... what else can I do?
Rintaro|I don’t have it in me to sacrifice anyone...
Rintaro|You... Mayuri... you’re my friends. I can’t lose either of you...
Suzuha|...
Rintaro|You have more to say?
Suzuha|Do I really... hang myself?
Rintaro|Yeah.
Suzuha|...Do I really fail my mission?
Rintaro|Yeah.
Suzuha|...
Suzuha|In that case...
Suzuha|Will you come with me, Okabe Rintaro?
Rintaro|...What?
Suzuha|Will you come with me? To 1975.
Rintaro|What will happen if I go?
Suzuha|You can help me, so that I don’t fail.
Suzuha|And maybe... we can find another way to change the future.
Rintaro|Is that... possible?
Suzuha|The worldline might shift in a completely unanticipated direction.
Suzuha|What you know as the present may change dramatically.
Suzuha|The Future Gadget Lab might not exist in the future we make.
Suzuha|Shiina Mayuri, Hashida Itaru, and Makise Kurisu might not even be born.
Suzuha|Even if they are born, they might be different people with different names.
Suzuha|But if we go to 1975, we’ll have 35 years before we reach the 2010 Divergence.
Suzuha|I don’t know how we’ll change the worldline, but we’ll have plenty of time to prepare.
Suzuha|If you’re okay with all that, then why not come with me?
Suzuha|To tell the truth... I want someone to come with me.
Suzuha|I don’t want to go knowing I’ll fail. I don’t want my death to be meaningless.
Suzuha|So come with me. Save me.
Suzuha|I want to save you too. I can’t bear to see you like this.
Suzuha|Will you continue this loop until your soul is ground to nothing? Once that happens, time will start moving again, and the ending you’ve been postponing will occur.
Suzuha|When your soul finally dies, Shiina Mayuri will die too. I will fail and hang myself. All according to schedule.
Suzuha|What you’re doing is nothing but slow suicide.
Suzuha|If you’re willing to go that far, then come with me instead.
Suzuha|Save me.
Rintaro|I...
Rintaro|I...
Rintaro|...I’ll go.
Rintaro|I’ll go with you. Please, take me with you.
Suzuha|Thank you.
Suzuha|...I’m sorry. I should have noticed sooner.
Suzuha|Remember, this time machine only goes one way. Once we leave, there’s no coming back.
Suzuha|Even so, will you still come with me?
Rintaro|And you? Are you sure about this?
Rintaro|There’s a good chance we’ll both lose our memories during the leap.
Suzuha|You said it took me 24 years to remember.
Suzuha|But this time, I have you. Something might change.
Rintaro|Wishful thinking.
Suzuha|Does that mean you’re backing out? I’m going, no matter what.
Rintaro|...No. I’ve made up my mind.
Suzuha|Did you tell everyone?
Rintaro|I... bid them farewell.
Suzuha|You know...
Suzuha|It’s kinda like we’re eloping.
Rintaro|There’s nothing to feel guilty about.
Rintaro|In fact, I want to thank you, Suzuha. If you hadn’t invited me, I’d still be in the loop, living like a corpse.
Rintaro|So thank you, Suzuha. Let’s fight to change the future, together.
Suzuha|...Yeah.
Suzuha|...
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|...Let’s go.
Rintaro|Yeah.
Rintaro|Ah!
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|It’s gone...
Rintaro|Daru, is the Yamanote Line stopped?
Itaru|Huh? Uh... I don’t think so?
Rintaro|Check online.
Itaru|Wait, I’m at the best part.
Rintaro|Please.
Itaru|Hmm, doesn’t look stopped.
Rintaro|Thanks.
Itaru|Are you waiting for someone? You keep looking out the window.
Rintaro|Mayuri. Kurisu.
Kurisu|Wait... did you just say my name correctly?
Rintaro|When you’re done eating, go home. It’s late, so I’ll go with you.
Mayuri|Okeydokey!
Kurisu|I don’t need an escort from you. I can get back by myself.
Rintaro|Just listen. Daru, you too.
Itaru|Huh? Me too?
Mayuri|...Hey, Okarin?
Rintaro|What?
Mayuri|Come on, Okarin... Mayushii gets nervous when you stare at her like that...
Rintaro|Did I make you get a game over?
Mayuri|Yeah.
Rintaro|Sorry about that.
Mayuri|There’s something different about you today, Okarin.
Rintaro|R-really?
Mayuri|Yeah. What’s wrong?
Rintaro|Heh. Nothing’s wrong! And I wasn’t looking at you just now. I was devising new ways to bring chaos to the world. Muhahaha!
Mayuri|Really? You seem kind of tired.
Rintaro|A mad scientist is never tired. The mighty gray cells of my 170-IQ brain are always performing calculations, day and night!
Mayuri|Oh... but you should still take a break every now and then. Please, Okarin. For me?
Rintaro|...
Tennouji|Okabe! You’ve got free time. How about a job? As a special offer, I’ll hire you for one CRT a month.
Rintaro|When did Suzuha quit, again?
Tennouji|Suzuha? Who the hell’s that?
Tennouji|I ain’t got time to remember the name of some lazy part-timer who quit after just ten days.
Rintaro|Damn you and your misleading words...
Tennouji|And I thought I finally had some help for a change. That’s what I hate about you damn kids. No dedication.
Rintaro|...
Tennouji|I bet she lied about liking CRTs, too. Got me good.
Rintaro|Does the name Hashida Suzu ring a bell?
Tennouji|Haven’t heard that name in a long time. Ya knew her?
Rintaro|Eh...?
Rintaro|So now, she’s...?
Tennouji|It’s been ten years already, huh.
Tennouji|She really helped me out.
Tennouji|She didn’t have any relatives, not that I knew of. I wish I could’ve been with her at the end.
Tennouji|To tell you the truth, though... she looked peaceful when I found her.
Rintaro|Peaceful? She... didn’t commit suicide?
Tennouji|Suicide? Who the hell told you that? Suzu-san was sick. Don’t believe any old thing you hear.
Tennouji|So how did you know Suzu-san?
Rintaro|...She helped me out too, a long time ago. I was hoping to see her again.
Tennouji|Yeah?
Tennouji|I’m living in her old house now. Wanna come pay your respects at the altar?
Rintaro|When did the satellite disappear?
Tennouji|Uh... about five days ago? You never know what’s gonna happen, huh.
Tennouji|Suzu-san loved that old thing.
Tennouji|Even when she couldn’t ride it anymore, she’d still polish it every week.
Tennouji|It’s been sitting there for ten years. Couldn’t throw it away. I’ve maintained it best I could, but I guess nothing lasts forever.
Tennouji|When Suzu-san and I first met, we were neighbors.
Tennouji|I was born and raised in Europe, you know.
Rintaro|Hah? Is that a joke?
Tennouji|Got a problem? I’ll have you know my English and French are perfect!
Tennouji|My parents died ’bout 15 years ago. That’s when I came back to Japan. Or, I guess I should say I came to Japan for the first time.
Tennouji|Suzu-san was living alone next door. She looked after me when I had nowhere else to turn.
Rintaro|...And you got married?
Tennouji|Huh? Married?
Rintaro|To Suzu-san.
Tennouji|You high?
Tennouji|She was a pretty stoic lady. Didn’t have much of a social life. 
Tennouji|But she treated me well.
Tennouji|My house burned down ’bout one year after I moved here. It was my smoking that caused the fire, so I deserved it, but still.
Tennouji|After I had lost everything, she let me come live here with her.
Tennouji|That’s not all. The Ohiyama Building, where the workshop’s at? That was originally Suzu-san’s property.
Rintaro|Eh!?
Tennouji|She sold it to me for cheap. It’s thanks to her the Braun Tube Workshop exists.
Tennouji|You could say she saved my life.
Tennouji|Once, I asked her why she treated me so well. It wasn’t like we were related or anything.
Tennouji|But she just smiled and said...
Tennouji|We all depend on someone’s kindness at some point in our lives. When the time comes, you pass the gift along.
Tennouji|She was kinda mysterious. She seemed to know exactly how things were gonna happen, like a prophet.
Rintaro|...
Tennouji|It’s a small world, huh? Never thought I’d meet someone else who knew her.
Tennouji|Oh, right! Wait here a sec.
Rintaro|Ah!
Suzuha|When the meter reads over 1%, you’ve made it to the Beta worldline.
Tennouji|Do you know what that number means?
Tennouji|’Cause I sure don’t. All I know is it hasn’t changed a bit these ten years.
Tennouji|But you know...
Tennouji|When Suzu-san was on her deathbed, she used to stare at that meter for hours.
Rintaro|Eh...?
Tennouji|She used to stare at that meter, talking to herself.
Tennouji|Is this the old number? The new number? Did it work? Did it change?
Tennouji|Stuff like that, day in and day out. It hurt to watch.
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Okarin♪
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ I didn’t think you’d come all the way to the station to pick me up. Mayushii’s surprised!
Rintaro|I wouldn’t want my hostage to get away.
Mayuri|Yeah, me neither! So, Mayushii’s really happy. Ehehe♪
Mayuri|So what’s in the bag?
Rintaro|Mister Braun gave it to me. It’s a device that can measure the divergence of worldlines.
Mayuri|Wow, that sounds amazing... what’s a worldline?
Rintaro|Mayuri, you really are a dummy.
Rintaro|Just a thought, Mayuri, but don’t you think maybe you should stop coming to Akiba for a while? At least until ComiMa ends.
Rintaro|Mayuri!?
Kurisu|So you’re the devoted type, huh?
Rintaro|What’s that supposed to mean?
Kurisu|All of a sudden, you’re treating Mayuri like a princess.
Kurisu|Today you went to the station to meet her, you taste tested her lunch, and then you held her hand all the way back to the lab.
Mayuri|Okarin really loves Mayushii! Ehehe!
Kurisu|So what’s the deal?
Rintaro|I don’t follow.
Kurisu|Are you a couple or what? I’ve been meaning to ask.
Rintaro|Do we look like a couple?
Kurisu|Huh!? Uh... well... umm...
Mayuri|You know, Okarin and Mayushii have been friends since we were little♪
Mayuri|Mwawoohii’s weeally hwawy nawo. 
Rintaro|Don’t talk with your mouth full.
Kurisu|So... you’re not a couple. Oh. Well, of course! No one would willingly date Okabe, after all.
Rintaro|Pff. You disappoint me, Christina!
Kurisu|Hah? What are you talking about?
Rintaro|You have finally revealed your true nature.
Rintaro|I saw how your eyes lit up at the first hint of romance! You’re nothing but a filthy mainstream girl!
Rintaro|I bet you like to eat chocolate with your girlfriends and giggle about the latest celebrity love affair! Absurd! This lab has no need of the puppies and flowers in your head!
Kurisu|What the hell are you on about, you self-proclaimed mad scientist chuunibyou nutcase?
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|The universe is like this piece of yarn.
Suzuha|Countless possible worldlines exist side by side, branching out to infinity.
Suzuha|When the meter reads over 1%, you’ve made it to the Beta worldline.
Suzuha|If you escape the Alpha attractor field and reach the Beta worldline... then the result will change.
Suzuha|Reach 1% divergence... and you’ll save Shiina Mayuri.
Kurisu|Okabe.
Kurisu|Didn’t you say we weren’t going to experiment with the Time Leap Machine?
Rintaro|This is just in case.
Kurisu|In case what?
Rintaro|...
Attacker A|Hands in the air. Nobody move.
Moeka|...
Mayuri|Um... Moeka-san?
Moeka|We’re taking the time machine.
Attacker A|Don’t move!
Moeka|Makise Kurisu, Okabe Rintaro, Hashida Itaru. The three of you will come with us.
Moeka|You cannot resist.
Moeka|Come with us.
Moeka|You have nowhere to run.
Moeka|We have men stationed throughout Akihabara.
Attacker A|Hey, you!
Attacker A|I said hands in the air.
Attacker A|What are you hiding!?
Rintaro|!!
Moeka|Shoot them!
Mayuri|Augh!
Rintaro|Mayu--
Mayuri|O...kari...
Mayuri|It... hurts...
Rintaro|Mayuri! Come on! Get up!
Kurisu|Stop! Stop!
Itaru|Don’t shoot meeeee!
Rintaro|Guh!
Rintaro|Ah, aahhh...
Attacker A|Target A, Target C secured.
Kurisu|Run, Okabe! Run!
Rintaro|Ah!
Rintaro|Mayu--
Mayuri|Okarin? You want a banana too?
Rintaro|Kurisu, come with me a second.
Kurisu|What is it? You don’t normally say my name normally.
Kurisu|That came out weird.
Rintaro|Please... help me.
Kurisu|...Now this is a shock.
Kurisu|I never thought I’d hear those words from you. Do you have a fever?
Rintaro|No jokes. I seriously need your help.
Kurisu|You time leaped, didn’t you?
Rintaro|How much do you know?
Kurisu|How much do I know about what?
Rintaro|How about Suzuha being John Titor?
Kurisu|Eh!?
Kurisu|It never even occurred to me.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Have you finished the Time Leap Machine?
Kurisu|What are you talking about? I finished it yesterday after an all-nighter, remember?
Kurisu|When did you leap from?
Rintaro|8 PM tonight.
Kurisu|Hmmm...
Kurisu|So basically, you win if you get the IBN 5100 back.
Kurisu|This is just a guess...
Kurisu|But maybe you should look at what Amane-san said from the opposite angle.
Kurisu|I think the critical change takes place when you get the IBN 5100 and erase the data in SERN’s database.
Kurisu|That instant is most likely when you’ll achieve divergence over 1%.
Rintaro|The problem is where the IBN 5100 is now.
Kurisu|You’ve already found it once. That is, if your memories are real.
Kurisu|If you can get back to the worldline where you first obtained it, then isn’t it bound to return to you?
Rintaro|I see... You’re right.
Rintaro|The IBN 5100 was at the lab, and then it suddenly disappeared.
Kurisu|You threw a fit about that earlier. I remember thinking, ’Oh god, Okabe’s finally lost his ability to distinguish fantasy from reality.’
Rintaro|You’re such a wannabe American. What do you mean, ’oh god’? Oh, I get it. Chris-chan is a Chris-tian.
Kurisu|That’s terrible.
Rintaro|...I regret it too.
Rintaro|So, Christina... let me see if I understand what you’re saying.
Rintaro|The changes we made to the worldline -- namely, all of the D-Mails we’ve sent -- must be reversed.
Rintaro|That will return us to the worldline where I found the IBN 5100 at Yanabayashi Shrine.
Kurisu|It’s still a hypothesis. I only came to that conclusion based on your explanation.
Kurisu|If you’re mistaking your facts, deceiving me, or shooting off delusions, then this hypothesis will fail.
Kurisu|You can’t just blindly follow this hypothesis either.
Kurisu|You may have a safety net, but if you get careless and leave yourself without a way out...
Kurisu|Then you’ll never get another chance to save Mayuri.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|Why did the IBN 5100 disappear? Which of the D-Mails caused its disappearance?
Kurisu|Figure that out, and you’re well on your way to finding the solution.
Rintaro|What I don’t understand is how we delayed the timing of Mayuri’s death exactly 24 hours.
Kurisu|True, that is interesting. Maybe it’s related to the change in divergence.
Kurisu|It could be the Butterfly Effect. If that’s the case, any trivial change could produce a significantly deviant result.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|Anyway, it’s important to act with discretion. Don’t do anything careless. 
Kurisu|Your death, Okabe, is the worst thing that could possibly happen.
Kurisu|You’re probably the only person who can remember previous worldlines. If you die, then consider Mayuri dead for good.
Kurisu|...Don’t die. Okay?
Rintaro|...You’re not worried about me, are you?
Kurisu|W-what!? Don’t be ridiculous! Why should I care!?
Kurisu|I’m not worried about you, okay? Don’t get the wrong idea.
Kurisu|I just don’t want to lose a valuable test subject, that’s all. Yeah!
Kurisu|That brain of yours has accumulated memories spanning worldlines and time leaps. It’s a precious sample that can rewrite the history of neuroscience!
Kurisu|I want to map your brain and find out just what’s going on in there.
Kurisu|In other words, your time leaping helps me, too! After all, the Time Leap Machine is the fruit of my research, so to speak, and I--
Rintaro|Calm down.
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|Christina. I’m going to give this plan of yours a shot.
Kurisu|Oh. G-great.
Kurisu|Ah...
Rintaro|You’ve been a great help. Sorry for the trouble.
Kurisu|D-don’t apologize, dummy. It’s confusing...
Kurisu|And besides, I don’t even remember helping you before! How are you going to take responsibility for this!?
Kurisu|I wish I could remember too...
Kurisu|Then I’d always have something to rub your nose in!
Rintaro|You really have an awful personality.
Kurisu|You’re one to talk.
Rintaro|Damn!
Butler|May I ask who’s calling?
Rintaro|Um, my name’s Okabe.
Rintaro|I’d like to speak with Fari... I mean Rumiho-san.
Butler|I regret to inform you that the young mistress is currently out.
Rintaro|Then where is she now?
Butler|I’m afraid I cannot answer that. You may be someone with whom she does not wish to interact.
Rintaro|I’ve been here before, remember!?
Butler|Of course, sir. However, I still cannot disclose the location of the young mistress. Please contact her directly.
Rintaro|P-please wait! I’ve been trying to get in touch with Faris, but she’s not returning my calls or emails!
Butler|Then please try again some other time.
Rintaro|Guh!
Itaru|Yeah? Okarin?
Rintaro|Daru, do you happen to know where Faris is right now?
Itaru|Faris-tan?
Rintaro|I need to talk to her right now!
Itaru|Right now? That’s not gonna happen.
Rintaro|Just tell me where she is! You keep tabs on her at all times, don’t you!?
Itaru|I know where she is, sure.
Rintaro|Where!? Where is she!?
Itaru|In the UPX assembly hall.
Rintaro|Why the assembly hall?
Itaru|Today’s the finals of the RaiNet AB GC.
Rintaro|RaiNet AB GC?
Itaru|Short for RaiNet AccessBattlers Grand Championship, duh.
Itaru|It’s the finals, man. Faris is participating.
Itaru|Faris-tan was the winner of this year’s winter GC, so she’s the defending champion. Just so you know.
Rintaro|She’s... in the finals?
Itaru|I’m here too, spectating. The match has already started, man.
Rintaro|I’m headed there now. What floor!?
Itaru|Do you have a ticket?
Rintaro|No, but I’ll manage!
Itaru|I don’t know, man. Security’s pretty tight. Someone posted threats on @channel.
Itaru|Pretty sure you’re not getting in.
Rintaro|Then you come out. I’m in front of UPX. Can you lend me your ticket?
Itaru|No way.
Itaru|It’ll end at four, so can’t you just wait until then?
Rintaro|H-hey! Daru! Daru!
Rintaro|Gh...!
Rintaro|Excuse me.
Rintaro|Do you know where RaiNet Champion Faris-san is?
???|What!?
???|RaiNet Champion Faris-san?
???|Pff, you guys hear that?
Rintaro|If you know, then please tell me.
Man Who Seems to Whisper to Gaia to Shine More|What, you’re a friend of the former champ?
Rintaro|!?
Man with a Bald Spot Who Seems to Whisper to Gaia to Shine More|Sorry, but you asked for it.
Man with a Bald Spot Who Seems to Whisper to Gaia to Shine More|It made my dirty heart ache to hear you call that pussy a champion.
Man with a Bald Spot Who Seems to Whisper to Gaia to Shine More|Get it? Don’t you ever call that disgusting catgirl a champion to my face again.
Man with a Bald Spot Who Seems to Whisper to Gaia to Shine More|Not unless you want your body and soul frozen by yours truly, the king of the streets, the one and only Black Absolute Zero, 4℃.
Man with a Bald Spot Who Seems to Whisper to Gaia to Shine More|The name’s 4℃. That’s Shido, you get me? I’m the strongest and coolest RaiNetter to ever rule the streets of Akiba. Nobody comes close. Nobody.
4℃|Did you know? Dry ice is so cold, it burns.
Rintaro|That’s not a burn. It’s frostbite.
4℃|What!?
Butler|May I ask who’s calling?
Rintaro|It’s Okabe. Has Fari... has Rumiho-san returned?
Butler|...Just a moment.
Butler|Please come up, sir. The young mistress will see you.
Rintaro|Faris! Finally. There’s something I need to ask you.
Faris|Hmmya...
Rintaro|What happened? You look down.
Faris|This can’t be happening, nya. Why did Faris have to lose, nyan?
Faris|If only those guys hadn’t used underhanded tricks on me, nya... They ganged up on Faris...
Faris|I even promised Papa I’d win... he’s probably disappointed in me, nya... I’m too ashamed to show my face, nya...
Rintaro|Listen, Faris!
Rintaro|A couple of days ago, you used the time machine we invented to send a D-Mail. Do you remember that?
Faris|Hanya?
Rintaro|Let’s say, for example, that there used to be tons of stores for anime otaku here in Akiba.
Rintaro|And let’s say you used a time machine, and changed that Akiba into the electric town it is today. How would you do it?
Faris|Time... machine...
Faris|Time machine...
Faris|Kyouma...
Rintaro|W-whoa! What!?
Faris|Is it a real time machine, nya?
Rintaro|...Yeah. It’s real.
Faris|...
Faris|I believe you, nyan.
Faris|Ugh... ugh... I’m about to remember, nya.
Rintaro|Huh?
Faris|Faris remembers using the time machine, nyan.
Rintaro|Wha... Really!?
Faris|Umm, Faris got on the time machine and it went zoom and...
Rintaro|What? But you didn’t ride anything, you sent a D-Mail to the past.
Faris|Nyanya! That’s it, nya, I’m starting to remember more and more, nya.
Faris|My head... hurts, nya.
Rintaro|What’s going on here?
Faris|Kyouma... Faris is... Faris is...
Faris|My brains are turning to mush, nya...
Rintaro|Hang in there!
Rintaro|Is there anything I can do?
Faris|If I win...
Faris|If I win, I might remember, nya.
Rintaro|Win? Win what?
Faris|Today’s match, nyan. Against the Viral Attackers, nya.
Faris|I only lost because of their underhanded tricks, nya.
Faris|And now my head is all mushy, so I can’t remember anything, nya.
Faris|Please, Kyouma... I think that if I win the match, I’ll remember everything, nya.
Faris|So please, nyan, let me use the time machine.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|By the way, this isn’t an act, right?
Faris|A-an act? What do you mean, nya?
Faris|You’re awful, nya.
Faris|Even though Faris is trying her bestest to remember for you...
Faris|You called me a liar... it hurts, nyan.
Rintaro|Ah, no, I’m sorry.
Faris|Please, nya...
Faris|Help Faris win, nyan...
Rintaro|W-wait! I get it! I get it, okay!?
Rintaro|O-okay, Faris. We’ll do it your way.
Faris|Fur real, nyan!?
Rintaro|Yeah. I need you to remember, whatever it takes.
Faris|Hnnya... why’d you dodge, nya?
Rintaro|Um... You’re being way too familiar.
Rintaro|I’m going to leap to this morning and give you some advice that will allow you to win. How’s that?
Faris|We’re not sending a mail, nyan?
Rintaro|Our lab has developed a device for time leaping, or sending your consciousness to the past.
Faris|Awesome! So it’s like New Game+, nya?
Rintaro|Umm, yeah, that’s it.
Faris|So if Faris uses it to go back to this morning, it’ll solve everything, nya!
Rintaro|You can’t!
Faris|Nya!? Why not, nyan?
Rintaro|I can’t let anyone else use the Time Leap Machine.
Faris|No fair, nya.
Rintaro|It’s not something to be used lightly. It’s dangerous.
Rintaro|I’ll be the one responsible for changing the past.
Rintaro|Trust me, Faris.
Faris|...Okay, nya.
Rintaro|Guh...
Faris|Bring Faris sunglasses and earplugs before the match, nyan!
Faris|Then I can ignore the distractions and win fur sure, nya.
Faris|Kyouma, what are you doing here, nya?
Rintaro|I waited here because I wanted to see you.
Faris|Hanya!? A-are you confessing your love for me? I don’t know what to do if you confess right before such an important match, nyan!
Rintaro|D-don’t be ridiculous! Why would I confess to you?
Faris|...You’re awfully serious today, nya. Usually you play along more, nya.
Faris|I’m nervous about the finals, so I want to lift my spirits, nyan.
Rintaro|Please just listen to me, Faris! This is important for your victory.
Faris|Important? But you don’t even know the rules of RaiNet, nya?
Rintaro|It’s not about the rules or anything like that.
Faris|Then what is it, nya?
Rintaro|Take these with you.
Faris|Kyouma... that’s lame, nya...
Faris|You’re supposed to bring nicer presents, like--
Rintaro|It’s not a present. These are countermeasures!
Faris|Nya?
Rintaro|Listen good. I came from the future.
Faris|I know, nya.
Rintaro|What!?
Faris|And Faris came from space, nya.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|I’m not joking around here! I seriously leapt here from six this evening!
Rintaro|I know the outcome of today’s RaiNet GC final.
Faris|Don’t tell me. Overwhelming victory for Faris--
Rintaro|No.
Rintaro|You lose.
Faris|Nyau...
Rintaro|But that’s only because of the opposing team’s interference. So to protect you, I brought you these sunglasses and earplugs.
Rintaro|Are you listening!?
Rintaro|Faris?
Faris|Unyaaaaa!
Faris|Kyouma, you meanie!
Faris|This is a very important match for Faris, nya! How dare you say I’ll lose nya! You’re being mean! Are you a Viral Attackers spy, nya!?
Rintaro|N-no, look, it wasn’t your fault you lost. It’s--
Faris|Hmya! Not listenyan!
Rintaro|Hgg...!
Rintaro|W-wait! I said wait!
Rintaro|I need you to win, no matter what!
Faris|Like I said, there’s no way I can lose, nya!
Faris|And I don’t wannya wear those ugly glasses, nya! Faris needs to be cute at every moment! My fans are counting on me, nya!
Rintaro|Please hear me out!
Rintaro|Faris, please. Mayuri’s life depends on it!
Faris|Someone! Someone come here, nya! Help me, nyan!
???|You seem to have an awful lot of time on your hands. Eh, Champion?
4℃|Heh. Swooping down unto the street, I am the black peacock of the RaiNetter realm.
4℃|The name’s 4℃. That’s Shido, you get me? I’m the leader of the Viral Attackers.
Faris|The Viral Attackers...
4℃|Seriously, you disappoint me, Champion.
4℃|You flirt with the system, but that’s just noise to my heart. And yet here you are, before the match, soaking in the corrupted love of that worthless man.
4℃|You put on the airs of a siamese cat, but with this duel today, I’ll dye that white fur of yours jet black. Gaia has thus whispered.
4℃|The black cat is the sign of disaster. My black radiance shall outshine your shadow, ushering in a new generation of RaiNet. Women are already slaves to the living Rock Mind that is myself.
Faris|Why is everyone getting in Faris’s way, nya? I can’t hear myself think, nya!
Rintaro|Faris, I told you to wait!
Faris|Paws off!
Rintaro|I’m begging you, please listen to what I’m saying!
4℃|Hey! Don’t you dare disregard the man closest to the truth of RaiNet.
Rintaro|This is none of your business. Go away.
4℃|The hell you say! Don’t you know I’m the black nobleman of the RaiNet realm!?
Rintaro|Weren’t you the black peacock of the RaiNet realm? Get your story straight.
4℃|I’m the black peacock nobleman. ’Cause black is the symbol of RaiNet.
Rintaro|Oh, I get it. You just like to say ’black.’
4℃|You think you’re so smart. I’m gonna dye that pussy black before the duel even starts.
4℃|You know what’ll happen if you touch me? Dry ice burns!
Rintaro|That’s frostbite, you idiot.
4℃|Wha!?
Rintaro|I’m telling you to stop messing with Faris!
Rintaro|Save your bullshit for someone who cares!
4℃|Heh! They’re laughing at you, you corrupt pussy l’amant!
Rintaro|I think not! They’re laughing at you, you pathetic peacock with a bald spot on your head.
4℃|What!? How do you know about my untouchable black spot!? I’ve never told anyone about it!
Rintaro|Elementary, 4℃ (YondoC). I am an insane mad scientist and traveler through time! Nothing escapes the sight of Hououin Kyouma.
4℃|The name’s Shido!
4℃|Now you’ve gone too far! For the sin of insulting my ultra-cool badass name, I’ll summon you to my garden, the black HELL! Just you wait!
Faris|How did you know about 4℃’s weak point, nyan? Nobody’s ever seen it.
Rintaro|Haven’t you been listening? I came from the future.
Faris|Ah...
Rintaro|So please, Faris, take this stuff. Just hold on to it, okay?
Faris|B-but... there’s no way Faris can lose, nya.
Rintaro|You’re stronger than them, no question. But you heard him just now. They’re obviously not gonna play fair.
Rintaro|They’ll do anything it takes to win, even if it breaks the RaiNetter code.
Faris|If you say so...
Faris|I’m just going to hold onto them. Is that okay, nya?
Rintaro|Yeah. Just make sure you have them with you on the stage. I promise you’ll need them.
Announcer|Thanks for waiting, everybody! The finals are about to begin, and we’ll see once and for all who is the RaiNet AccessBattlers Grand Champion!
Announcer|These two teams are about to clash!
Announcer|First up, the defending champion! Our queen! The Moe Maid Cat!
Announcer|Fariiiiis! NyaaanNyaaaaaaaaaan!
Announcer|And now, the challengers! Like a comet they suddenly appeared, blazing across the starry sky! The dark horse -- nay, dark peacock of the RaiNet world!
Announcer|This is their very first tournament, but despite various troubles including no-show opponents, they have made it to the finals! They are the Black Absolute Zero!
Announcer|The Viraaaaal! Attackeeeeers!
Itaru|You gotta cheer for Faris-tan too!
Rintaro|Yeah...
Spectator A|Faris-tan!
Spectator B|I love you, Faris!
Spectator C|Moe moe!!
Faris|I’m gonna give it my best, everyone! So cheer for me, nyan♪
Faris|Ehehehe. Service shot, nyan♪
Itaru|There it is! Yes! Faris! It’s me! Marry me!
Rintaro|How come there are two Viral Attackers, but Faris is all alone?
Itaru|What? You don’t even know about that?
Itaru|In this tournament, duels take place between two-man teams. But since there’s nobody strong enough to be Faris-tan’s duel partner, she goes alone.
Itaru|Two heads are obviously better than one, but Faris can win despite her handicap! That’s why I love her!
Rintaro|These Viral Attackers... what sort of team are they?
Itaru|Hmm. I don’t know all the details, but apparently they’re a pretty aggressive team.
Itaru|But other than that, there’s a bunch of suspicious rumors about them.
Itaru|They’ve got a lot of followers, you see. And apparently, they don’t mind using those followers to interfere with their opponents during duels.
Itaru|About half the teams they faced in the championships were no-shows.
Itaru|And that’s not all. Apparently, they even go around beating up otaku in Akiba and Ikebukuro.
Itaru|Long story short, RaiNetters really hate them.
Rintaro|Then why haven’t they been disqualified?
Itaru|Cause there’s no evidence. RaiNetters are mostly kids and otaku. Just a little intimidation from some guys in black, and they clam up.
Rintaro|How do teams work exactly?
Itaru|You can discuss with your partner what moves to make. It’s harder for the opponent to predict what you’re going to do.
Itaru|Well, there’s nothing to worry about. Faris-tan can beat the daylights outta these punks in the blink of an eye.
Announcer|Are both teams ready?
Announcer|And now, for the RaiNet AccessBattlers Grand Championship Finals--
Announcer|Duel Access!
Rintaro|What sort of strategy does Faris use?
Itaru|I guess you could say she’s a slow starter. She spends the first half focusing on reading her opponent’s cards. She plays it safe.
Itaru|And instead, she waits until the endgame for a sudden reversal.
Itaru|That’s probably how she’ll play it this time, too.
Itaru|Now, what’s it gonna be?
Itaru|No way!
Rintaro|What happened!?
Itaru|I can’t believe it. She took a Virus Card...
Itaru|She almost never goes on the offensive. Maybe the Virals are enough of a threat to warrant a change of strategy.
4℃|Pff, looks like our pussy champ here is frightened by the heavy rock wings of the black peacock. Your fear is showing.
4℃|I can see your cowardly pussy-shivering with these fallen angel eyes of mine.
4℃|This little ’strategy change’ of yours? It’s an obvious fake. My elegant evil heart whispers so.
4℃|I’ve done my research. You never go on the offensive. You’re the cautious, thinking-type.
4℃|I know all about your little mind tricks. You can’t fool me.
4℃|That card you attacked with just now is a Virus Card, no doubt. You think I’ll take the bait, don’t you?
Faris|...
4℃|This black nobleman set off a red alarm in your heart, awakening your wild survival instincts. And that’s why you suddenly changed your strategy.
4℃|But it’s too late for that now. Such inelegant tricks as that have not a chance to stain our blackness.
4℃|For we are the Viral Attackers, the Black Justice. The usurpers of RaiNet. The rebellion against this fickle Sanctuary.
Rintaro|He sure can talk...
Itaru|I hate those guys.
Itaru|Well, you gotta admit. Pressuring your opponent is an important part of RaiNet.
Itaru|If you shake your opponent up, their reaction might help you figure out their card layout.
Rintaro|...This game sounds pretty hardcore.
Itaru|To tell you the truth, RaiNet’s more popular with adults than with kids. Even the anime’s like that. It’s marketed towards kids, but the story’s going down a pretty hard route.
Itaru|That, and Kirari-chan’s sexy!
Rintaro|A laser!
Itaru|Eh? What?
Rintaro|Look! Near her eyes! There’s a red dot!
Itaru|...Seriously?
Itaru|I can’t tell. But if you’re right, Okarin, then someone in the audience is trying to sabotage her! Damn those Virals!
Rintaro|Why doesn’t the referee stop them!?
Itaru|They must be timing it so that the referee doesn’t see.
Itaru|Hey, where are you going!?
Rintaro|I’m going to find whoever’s doing this and stop them!
Itaru|But how are you gonna find them in this crowd!?
4℃|Hey hey hey!
4℃|Looks like this fucking cat got scared of my elegant evil charisma aura, and lost her cool heart.
4℃|Who would’ve thought the champion would make such an amateurish move?
Faris|...
4℃|Allow this elegant evil storyteller, 4℃, to make a jet black proclamation.
4℃|In just a few minutes, you’ll be demoted to Former Champion!
4℃|Hahahaha!
Viral Attacker C|Wh-who are you!?
Rintaro|That’s as far as you go. I won’t let you interfere with Faris’s match!
Viral Attacker C|Why you!
Rintaro|Move and I shoot!
Viral Attacker C|...!?
4℃|Too weak, Pussy. But it’s your fault for flirting with the system in that getup of yours. Save that vomit-inducing fashion sense for your bedroom mirror.
4℃|All of your fans are just otakus who wanna do you. Does it really make you that happy to to have a fanbase filled with people like that?
Rintaro|What!?
4℃|Hey, Champion. They say your eyes can see into a man’s soul.
4℃|They say you have the power to read minds, which makes you a cheater even my pure black evil heart can’t abide.
4℃|Basically, ya ain’t human. You’re an ugly angel. ’Cause you peek into the heart of any poor sap who talks to you.
4℃|Everyone, beware! Keep your distance! Or this pussy will steal your every secret by reading your thoughts!
4℃|And then she’ll blackmail you. Hand over your money? Throw your RaiNet match? What will you demand next!?
Rintaro|Faris!
Faris|...ctory
4℃|Ah? What was that?
Faris|...I use Change Directory. Nya.
4℃|You can’t touch my heartstrings with a boring move like that. Is this your huge reversal plan?
4℃|Sorry, but I am the black peacock no woman can resist. The elegant evil New Generation of the RaiNetter realm.
4℃|My cool black brain easily sees through your trick.
4℃|No, that wasn’t even a trick. That was a complete blunder, Champion.
4℃|Heh! I still only have two Virus Cards. One card ain’t enough to clip these jet black wings of mine.
4℃|But if I take just one more Link Card, then it’s the ’End of Grand Cross’ for you!
4℃|By the way, that card you’re protecting way back in your territory...
4℃|That’s the card you used in the opening. The one you equipped with Line Boost and used to attack me, as if inviting me to take it.
4℃|I said it before, but there’s no way a scaredy-cat like you would send a Link Card out where it could be captured.
4℃|In other words, Champion, according to my elegant evil skills of deduction, your last Link Card isn’t the one you’re guarding. It’s one of the two you switched! Heh!
4℃|So I don’t even have to check. This black peacock’s sexual eyes can already see my elegant victory. They can see the contents of your crazy cards!
4℃|You exchanged one Virus and one Link.
4℃|So all I’ve gotta do is take both, and victory belongs to us black noblemen.
4℃|Card Open!
Announcer|A Virus Card!
4℃|The End. The world has dyed black the closing of this RaiNet century.
4℃|The Black Revelations have been fulfilled. The Pussy Champ has fallen from grace to Former Champ. We, the Viral Attackers, now raise the curtain to the highest, grandest, sexiest New Genera--
Faris|What are you talking about, nya?
4℃|Ah...?
Faris|This match isn’t over yet, nyan!
4℃|Wh-what dreamy nonsense are you spewing? The match is already won. You’re just pawing at the ground.
Faris|Why don’t you check the card you just took from Faris, nya?
4℃|...What?
4℃|N-no freaking way! In the name of all that is elegant and evil, that’s just impossible! That’s bullshit!
4℃|There’s no way you’d shoot yourself in the foot by wasting Change Directory to switch two Virus Cards--
Faris|Just turn over the card and see for yourself already, nya♪
Announcer|What!? Just when we all thought the card was a Link Card!
4℃|A V-v-virus Card!!?
Announcer|A HUGE! TURN! A! ROUUUUUUUUUUUUND!!
Announcer|We have our winner! Fariiiis NyaaanNyan! Two time undefeated champion! Congratulatioooons!
Faris|Kyouma!
Rintaro|Congratulations on your victory, Fa--
Faris|Thanks for everything, nyan!
Rintaro|N-no... I can’t have you thanking me like this. I need something else from you.
Faris|What’s that, nya? You mean a kiss isn’t enough, so you want to go on a date, nyan? Aww, Kyouma, you’re so greedy, nyan.
Faris|But you know, Faris doesn’t mind, nya♪
Rintaro|I’m glad those earplugs I gave you did the trick. So get off, it’s too hot.
Faris|I’m sorry for doubting you, nya. It wouldn’t have been such a close game if I just believed you to begin with, nya.
Rintaro|Faris. Now you’ll listen to what I have to say, right?
Faris|Nya?
Rintaro|I brought you sunglasses and earplugs. But I didn’t come up with the idea.
Faris|Really, nya? Then who--
Rintaro|You did.
Rintaro|To be precise, the you two hours from now. The first time, you lost to the Viral Attackers’ underhanded tactics.
Rintaro|And then you asked me to use my time machine to stop them.
Faris|Your time machine...
Rintaro|This was a contract, so to speak. You almost remembered the D-Mail you sent to change the past, even though you should’ve forgotten.
Rintaro|You said that you’d remember if you won the RaiNet tournament.
Faris|???
Rintaro|Well? Do you remember? It’s very important, so I need you to try.
Faris|Hm...
Faris|Faris was probably pulling your tail, nya.
Rintaro|What?
Faris|That Faris was depressed she lost to the Virals, nya? So when she heard about the time machine, she wanted to use it to win, nya.
Faris|Because if she didn’t, she’d be too ashamed to see Papa, nya...
Faris|I’m sure she just played along with Kyouma, and said she remembered... that’s what I think, nya... That’s probably what Faris would do, nya.
Rintaro|No way...
Faris|Kyouma.
Faris|Look into Faris’s eyes, nya.
Rintaro|What?
Faris|Just look, nya.
Faris|Nervous, nya?
Rintaro|O-of course not. I’m busy solving Fermat’s Last Theorem in my head.
Faris|In other words, you’re nervous, nya.
Faris|The truth is, Faris has only one power, nya.
Rintaro|Your power? Do you mean...
Faris|It’s a secret, but I’ll make an exception for Kyouma. Truth is, Faris can read people’s minds, nyan.
Faris|I call my power Cheshire Break.
Faris|Whatcha think, nya? Awesome, nyan?
Rintaro|...I’m an exception? But the Virals knew about it too, didn’t they?
Faris|I had no idea the cat was out of the bag, nya.
Faris|Ever since I was small, I could tell what Papa’s business partners were thinking from the looks on their faces, nya.
Faris|It’s more like intuition or a sixth sense, nya. Based on eye movements, facial expressions, and gestures, I can tell when someone’s lying, nya.
Rintaro|...Wait, so you’ve been using that power at RaiNet tournaments?
Faris|Of course, nya♪ Faris is an entertainer, nyan. It’s my style to get into a tight spot on purpose so I can make a huge turnaround, nyan.
Faris|Besides, if I wear sunglasses, I can’t read my opponent’s thoughts, nyan.
Faris|It’s because of this power that I knew you weren’t lying.
Rintaro|But you wouldn’t go along with me at all in the beginning, though.
Faris|You just rubbed my fur the wrong way, nya.
Faris|And I can tell you’re not lying now either, nya.
Rintaro|...
Faris|Faris used that ’D-Mail’ thing to change the past, nya? I believe you, nya.
Faris|I wish I could remember... but I’m sorry, nya.
Faris|I can’t remember, nyan...
Rintaro|I see...
Rintaro|...?
4℃|Yo.
4℃|I’ve got a word with you, champion. Gaia whispered for me to register an objection.
Faris|An objection?
4℃|You damn pussy. The power to read the minds of your opponents? That’s bullshit! I know you were cheating!
Rintaro|She wasn’t cheating! You’re the ones who were cheating!
Faris|Faris doesn’t use underhanded tricks like you guys, nya.
4℃|The hell you say? I, the black nobleman, swear to the god of the elegant evil realm, that I never cheat! Though sometimes I do other things.
4℃|Okay, you corrupt white Siamese cat? I ain’t gonna accept that defeat. That last Change Directory was a fraud.
Rintaro|You don’t have any proof.
4℃|Heh! You seem clueless, so I’ll tell ya. If I say it’s black, it’s black. That’s the truth of RaiNet.
4℃|By the way, your old man’s some kind of big shot in Akihabara, isn’t he?
4℃|I bet he pulled strings so they’d let you win. That’s what all the hip RaiNetters are saying, you know?
4℃|You’re such a scoundrel. Ya ain’t got a bit of elegant evility. Ya ain’t even a white Siamese cat.
4℃|You’re a fatass pig, crawling in the mud.
Viral Attacker A|Seriously? I thought it went way too well, but you’re telling me it was rigged?
Viral Attacker B|This catgirl’s the worst!
Viral Attacker C|So that’s the kind of person Faris is. A filthy cheater!
4℃|That’s how it is, Champion -- no, SHAMpion.
4℃|On your knees. Bow before me, the Black Lucifer, 4℃. Rub your head on the ground, and beg for mercy.
4℃|And then forfeit your throne. Do all that, and I swear to Lucifer to forgive you for your deeds.
Viral Attacker D|That’s right! Turn down your victory!
Viral Attacker E|And never come back to RaiNet AccessBattlers again!
Viral Attacker F|Quit RaiNet, you bitch!
Rintaro|Let’s go, Faris.
Faris|Nya...?
4℃|Hold it right there!
Rintaro|Hello!?
Itaru|It’s me.
Rintaro|What!? I’m! Busy! Now!
Itaru|You still at the hall?
Rintaro|No!
Itaru|You haven’t seen Faris-tan, have you? Actually, everything’s on fire--
Rintaro|On fire!? What is!?
Itaru|Her blogs and fan sites!
Rintaro|I’m hanging up!
Faris|Kyouma! Those guys! Are still tailing us, nyan!
Rintaro|Tch...!
Rintaro|Haah, haah, whew!
Faris|Haahaah, whew, whewww...
Faris|Kyouma! Look, nya!
Rintaro|What?
Faris|We can’t get in like this, nya...
Rintaro|Let’s get out of here!
Viral Attacker A|There they are!
Viral Attacker B|Text the location!
Rintaro|...!
Rintaro|Wheww, whew, haahaahaah...
Faris|Why are we stopping here, nya? We need to run!
Rintaro|Let’s wait here until those assholes give up.
Rintaro|--whew
Rintaro|Haah, haah... If this were MayQueen, we’d have air conditioning, and I could get something to drink...
Faris|Nya?
Rintaro|Oh, nothing...
Faris|How do you know the name of the maid cafe that was supposed to open here, nya?
Rintaro|Eh...?
Faris|Oh, I know. We opened up the homepage for a little bit to post maid recruiting information, nyan. Did you see it?
Rintaro|...It was supposed to open?
Faris|Faris organyaized the cafe’s plans and passed it through the conference. It was almost a done deal, nyan.
Faris|But at the last moment, Papa put his paw down, and the plan died, nya.
Faris|Papa’s such a blockhead, nya...
Faris|If he left the store to me, it would’ve been the best maid cafe in all of Japan, with mmhmm costumes and hnngtastic maids, nya.
Faris|It would’ve even pulled customers to Akiba from all the way over in Ueno and Ikebukuro. It’s such a waste, nya.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Faris... no, Akiha Rumiho.
Faris|Hanyan?
Rintaro|You’re the Akiha daughter and heir, so you go to the Akihabara city development conferences too, right?
Faris|Nnya? I don’t attend, nya.
Rintaro|You don’t? But didn’t you say that...
Faris|Papa’s the one who goes to the conferences, nya. Why would Faris have to go nya?
Rintaro|Then, why did you go to the conferences?
Faris|Like I said, I don’t, nya.
Rintaro|Your dad’s into retro PCs, right?
Faris|Yeah! By the way, we still haven’t found an IBN 5100, nyan.
Rintaro|Has your dad ever sold any or given one away?
Faris|Never, nya. Papa loves all of the PCs he’s collected, nya. He’d never get rid of one, nya.
Rintaro|Do you have any retro PCs, Faris?
Faris|I don’t get Papa’s hobby at all, nya. Faris likes cosplay and anime and cute things, nyan.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Let’s say you participated in city development ever since you were a child.
Faris|I’d put moe shops all over Akiba, nya. Just visit ComiMa and you’ll see the wonder of otaku power, nya.
Faris|I’m sure more people would visit Akiba then, nyan.
Rintaro|That aside, if you no longer wanted to participate after participating for all that time...
Rintaro|How would you stop yourself in the past?
Faris|Is this some sorta psychological test, nya?
Rintaro|It’s just a hypothetical question.
Faris|Hm... a dramatic way would be purrfect.
Rintaro|What?
Faris|Like you see on TV, nya. Faris is weak to drama, nya. I probably got that from Papa, nyan.
Faris|For example, if Faris got kidnapped or--
Faris|Kid...napped?
Rintaro|Faris?
Faris|Ugh...
Faris|My head hurts, nya...
Faris|H-hey, Kyouma... Faris has been feeling funny since coming to this storehouse, nya... Even though I only came here once, back when I was a little kitten...
Faris|It feels really... nyastalgic...
Faris|Like I’ve been here... many times, nya...
Faris|Ah...
Faris|I... remember...
Rintaro|Remember what?
Faris|I remember, nya!
Faris|MayQueen+Nyan²!
Faris|Kyouma and Daru-nyan were regular customers, nya. And Mayushii worked here too, nya.
Rintaro|Really? You really remember that?
Faris|And how Kyouma and Daru talked about the time machine at the store, and how I asked to use it in return for helping find an IBN 5100.
Faris|And how later, I convinced Kyouma and Daru-nyan it was weird to compare time to a river.
Faris|And how I took the blood oath to become a lab mem.
Rintaro|And the D-Mail? Do you remember what you sent?
Faris|...
Faris|I remember, but... you said you have to cancel it, nya?
Rintaro|Yes. I need to undo the changes made to the past by your D-Mail.
Faris|You can’t, nya!
Faris|You can’t undo it, nya...
Rintaro|Please listen, Faris! Mayuri’s life depends on it!
Faris|Eh... Mayushii’s...?
Rintaro|If we don’t return the worldline to normal... if I don’t get that IBN 5100, then Mayuri will die.
Rintaro|It know it sounds ridiculous, but it’s the truth.
Rintaro|So please. I need to send another D-Mail and cancel the one you--
Faris|The wish Faris made with her D-Mail...
Faris|The wish Faris made...
Faris|...was to save Papa, who died ten years ago, nya.
Rintaro|--!?
Faris|I exchanged the past where Papa died, for a past where he didn’t die, nyan.
Rintaro|!?
Viral Attacker A|Is Faris really hiding in here?
Viral Attacker B|Someone saw two people who looked like them go inside.
Rintaro|...!
Viral Attacker A|Where are you!?
Viral Attacker B|So you were here, Faris.
Rintaro|Yeah!?
Kurisu|Okabe! Can you hear me!? We called a taxi, but it’ll take some time to get there.
Rintaro|You exposed us to the pursuers. They’re right in front of us!
Viral Attacker A|Hey, come out!
Viral Attacker B|There’s no point in hiding!
Kurisu|I see. Then I’ll lecture you on how to escape. You’re in the same the place you were before, right?
Kurisu|Scatter the flour and make a break for it. OK?
Kurisu|Then switch on the light.
Rintaro|Roger. Over and out.
Faris|!?
Viral Attacker A|What the hell!?
Viral Attacker B|I can’t see! Cough cough!
Faris|Khohkhoh, khohkhohkhoh!
Viral Attacker A|Hey, we found you!
Viral Attacker B|Hehhehhe! You can’t escape!
Faris|Oh no! 4℃ got run over by a car, nya!
Viral Attacker A|Wh-what!? 4℃-san!?
Rintaro|Nice feint, Faris!
Viral Attacker C|You’re not getting away!
Viral Attacker D|Get them!
Faris|Oh no...
4℃|Yo! We got you now.
4℃|I’ll tell ya one thing. You can’t escape my totally bad black aura.
4℃|I always fight the system. And once again, my elegant evil story ends in perfect victory.
Rintaro|Stop. Don’t you lay a finger on me.
Rintaro|If you take another step, the power in my right arm... will break free!
4℃|Always at the front line of the scene stands one man. That one man, is the peacock flapping its black wings.
Rintaro|Gwaaaaah! Calm down, right arm of mine! No! The seal is... coming undone! Run away, all of you! Your lives are in jeopardy!
4℃|I’ll elegantly floor you with my crazy dance. The one chosen by the jet black wings is none other than I.
Rintaro|No... my right hand... my right haaaaand! Please, stop! I don’t want to kill any moooore!
4℃|Hey, what the hell is he doing?
Viral Attacker C|Don’t let him trick you! He’s just a textbook chuunibyou case!
Rintaro|Yeah, like you guys can talk.
Viral Attacker D|Whatever! Just kick his ass!
Rintaro|Very well... then prepare yourselves! Releasing restriction si--
Rintaro|Gweh...
Faris|Kyouma!
4℃|Heh! I told you, man! The coldest ice burns!
Rintaro|That’s frostbite, you idiot--
4℃|Why you!
Faris|Kyouma!
Faris|Stop it, nya! Don’t hurt Kyouma any more!
4℃|Don’t tell me what to do! I only listen to the whispers of Gaia!
Faris|Stop it! Someone, help!
Faris’s Dad|Get inside!
Faris|P-Papa!
Faris|Hang in there, nya!
4℃|W-wait! You’re not getting away!
Faris’s Dad|I really need to thank you, Okabe-kun. Thank you for protecting my daughter.
Rintaro|P-protecting...?
Rintaro|I wasn’t able to do anything against those guys. I was pathetic...
Faris’s Dad|Absolutely not. You saved my daughter’s life.
Faris|Oh, Papa... I thought I told you not to push yourself since you’ve got important work to do. You should listen to me, nya.
Faris|The wish Faris made...
Faris|...was to save Papa, who died ten years ago, nya.
Faris’s Dad|I always keep my promises to you, Rumiho.
Faris’s Dad|I made that decision long ago.
Faris|Papa... thank you, nya.
Faris’s Dad|So you’re looking for an IBN 5100?
Rintaro|That’s right. I heard you were an enthusiastic retro PC collector. Do you know anything about it?
Faris’s Dad|It’s quite unusual for a man your age to know about the IBN 5100.
Faris’s Dad|I did have one. I gave it away, though.
Rintaro|You... gave it away?
Faris’s Dad|Yes. I had a compelling reason.
Rintaro|Did you donate it to Yanabayashi Shrine?
Faris’s Dad|To a shrine? No...
Faris’s Dad|I don’t think Hashida-san, who entrusted the IBN 5100 to me, could ever forgive me for what I did...
Rintaro|Hashida? As in Hashida Suzu?
Faris’s Dad|This is an old story... a story from before my company got as big as it is.
Faris’s Dad|Rumiho was kidnapped. The kidnapper demanded an unthinkable ransom.
Faris’s Dad|Maybe I should have mortgaged the company instead.
Faris’s Dad|But at that moment, someone appeared, like a godsend, offering a large sum of money to buy my IBN 5100.
Faris’s Dad|I sold it, which gave me enough to prepare Rumiho’s ransom.
Faris|Let’s not talk about that, nya...
Rintaro|So who was the buyer?
Faris’s Dad|Hmm, a French businessman, I believe. I think I still have his contact information. Would you like it?
Rintaro|...
Faris|Kyouma?
Rintaro|Oh, Faris. Still awake?
Faris|May I come in?
Faris|...Um. Thanks for earlier.
Faris|When the Viral gang started chasing me, I was really scared.
Faris|That was the first time I ever felt such black emotion from a huge crowd of people.
Rintaro|Those guys were obsessed with black.
Faris|Come on. I’m trying to be serious.
Faris|Does it still hurt?
Rintaro|No, I’m fine.
Faris|Kyouma... I mean, Okabe-san. I don’t know what would’ve happened if you hadn’t been there. I shiver just thinking about it.
Rintaro|Don’t correct yourself like that. Just call me what you usually do.
Faris|Anyway, Kyouma, I can’t thank you enough. Thank you, honestly...
Faris|You know, Kyouma... You’re my prince.
Rintaro|I am not a prince! I am an insane mad scientist and--
Rintaro|...!?
Rintaro|F-Faris...?
Faris|I want you to call me Rumiho.
Rintaro|No, Faris is Faris, remember?
Faris|Hey... I think it’s time to end this.
Rintaro|...
Faris|You went back in time, and risked your life to save me.
Faris|So, I want to grant your wish too.
Rintaro|But...
Faris|It was on my eighth birthday.
Faris|I wanted Papa to take a break from work so he could spend time with me.
Faris|Papa’s company wasn’t as big back then, so he worked every day, from morning to night. I never got to see him.
Faris|The present I wanted most was for him to spend one whole day with me.
Faris|And Papa promised. He promised he’d spend the entire day with me, no matter what.
Faris|But...
Faris|Something came up, and he had to break his promise the day before.
Faris|I was so afraid that Papa didn’t really love me.
Faris|So on my birthday, I ran away from home. I wanted to make Papa worry.
Faris|...The plane Papa was on made a bad landing.
Faris|Only one person died in the accident. Everyone else was unharmed.
Faris|The one casualty... was Papa...
Rintaro|...
Faris|I couldn’t believe the world would be so cruel to me.
Faris|’I hate you, Papa! You should just die!’
Faris|Those were the last words I ever said to him.
Faris|...And that’s how our relationship ended, forever.
Faris|I loved him... so why? Why did I say those things to him? I always felt guilty because of what I said.
Faris|I always wished I could go back in time... change what happened.
Faris|When I heard you talking about your time machine, I thought I was being given a chance.
Rintaro|Faris... Rumiho. That’s enough for today. You don’t have to say anything more.
Faris|No. Let me finish.
Faris|I’m okay now. Papa came to save me... so I know how much he really loves me.
Faris|I really enjoyed having this time to spend with him. It was like a gift to us from heaven.
Faris|But now you need to change things back to the way they were.
Rintaro|But...
Faris|Mayushii’s a very important friend to me. If Mayushii’s in danger, I’ll do anything to save her.
Rintaro|...I’m sorry.
Faris|Weren’t you listening? This current reality isn’t reality at all, but rather, a gift to my father and me.
Faris|Or maybe I should call it a dream. Papa doesn’t belong in this time. You’re just turning things back to normal.
Faris|Thank you for letting me have this dream, Kyouma.
Rintaro|Are you... really okay with that?
Faris|...
Faris|A-actually... I’m not okay at all...
Faris|I remember how things were before the world changed...
Faris|But I also remember how everything was after the world changed, you know?
Faris|I’m actually kind of freaking out right now.
Faris|What happened before the change and after the change are all mixed up inside me. I don’t know which one is real anymore.
Faris|But if I try to fight it, it’ll just make you sad, won’t it?
Faris|I don’t want to make you sad. You are my prince, after all.
Rintaro|We can do something! There might be a world where you don’t lose your dad and Mayuri doesn’t die! If we try--
Faris|It’s okay. I’ve accepted it.
Faris|I don’t want to run away anymore.
Rintaro|...Thank you.
Faris|Hey, is it okay if I cry a little? Before we change things back, is it okay... if I cry for Papa?
Faris|Kyouma...
Rintaro|Faris...
Faris|I’ll go say my last goodbyes to Papa now, nyan.
Faris|Let me be alone with Papa for a while, nya.
Rintaro|...
Faris|...
Faris|Don’t be like that, Kyouma. You’ve done nothing wrong, nyan.
Rintaro|But...
Faris|NyanNyan♪ No more talking, nyan!
Rintaro|...Okay.
Faris|Um... when we change things back, will my memories of this world disappear, nya?
Rintaro|...Of course not. You’ll remember.
Rintaro|You have memories from both worlds right now, don’t you?
Faris|Is that why you were so desperate to help Faris, nya?
Rintaro|That’s... open to your interpretation.
Faris|Faris...
Faris|Doesn’t want to forget her time with Kyouma, nya.
Rintaro|...Thank you.
Faris|Bye bye... Papa.
Faris|Kyouma...?
Rintaro|I won’t let this dream end yet.
Rintaro|Let’s try another way.
Rintaro|I... can’t kill your dad.
Faris|Kyouma...
Faris|I’m sorry, nya.
Faris|Faris led you astray, nya.
Rintaro|No, it’s okay. This is my decision.
Faris|Do you have something in mind, nya?
Rintaro|It’s a gamble...
Rintaro|But we can change the contents of the D-Mail you sent.
Faris|We’re not going to cancel the first prank mail, nya?
Rintaro|Exactly.
Rintaro|I win as long as I get back the IBN 5100. Your father doesn’t need to die.
Rintaro|Uh, we’re talking about a game...
Rintaro|I think we should send a D-Mail that says something like...
Rintaro|’Give the IBN 5100 to Okabe Rintaro.’
Faris|But you know, back then, Papa’s company was down and he didn’t have much capital, nya.
Faris|I doubt you could say anything to stop him from selling the IBN 5100 if he needed money to save me, nyan.
Rintaro|That depends on what we send. If we make it seem like it came from the kidnappers, then your father has to find another way.
Rintaro|He’s a retro PC collector, so he should have plenty of other PCs he could sell, right?
Faris|He wouldn’t get enough money with those, nyan. Back then, the IBN 5100 was the only one people would pay through the nose for, nyan.
Rintaro|Then this is something only you can pull off.
Rintaro|I’ll say it again. This is only a bet.
Rintaro|How will the worldline change? What will that new worldline bring? I don’t have the answers.
Rintaro|It may become a world where neither Mayuri nor your father can be saved, but it could also be one where both can.
Rintaro|There’s no way to be sure, but I can’t leave things the way they are. I can’t let Mayuri die. And I can’t let your dad die.
Faris|If that’s your decision... then it’s okay with me, nyan.
Rintaro|...Really?
Faris|I know that you’re trying to save Papa, nyan.
Faris|And I’m really grateful for that, nyan.
Faris|I think I’m falling in love with you, nya.
Rintaro|D-don’t tease me like that.
Faris|But I’m not just teasing, nyan.
Faris|Does Kyouma hate girls like me, nya?
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|N-no wonder you’re MayQueen’s number one maid! You know how to flatter your customers...
Faris|...I don’t like it when Kyouma dodges the question, nya. 
Rintaro|Faris... let’s do this together.
Rintaro|It’ll come out all right... trust me.
Faris|I guess you’re never gonna answer me, nya...
Faris|...I’m with you, Kyouma. Let’s send that D-Mail, nya.
Rintaro|There’s no turning back.
Faris|It hope I still remember you, nya, after the worldline changes.
Rintaro|Even if you forget, I’ll remember.
Faris|Kyouma, I wannya hold hands.
Rintaro|Go for it, Faris.
Faris|Sending... nyan.
Rintaro|Wha...!?
Rintaro|This is...
Rintaro|All the moe stores are back...
Nae|Um... wh-who are you? What do you want?
Rintaro|Sorry for the sudden visit. I’m done.
Rintaro|By the way, your old man’s the one who showed me how to get here.
Nae|Who are you? Please, get out. If you don’t, I’ll call the police. And my daddy’s really, really strong.
Rintaro|...?
Rintaro|Who am I? Come on. We’ve met any number of times.
Nae|...?
Rintaro|I rent out the second floor of your old man’s shop. Remember?
Nae|H-help, Daddy!
Rintaro|Whoa! Now hold on a second.
Nae|If you touch me, I’ll bite my tongue and die!
Rintaro|I’m not gonna touch you, okay? You really don’t remember me?
Rintaro|We’ve never met?
Rintaro|Oh... sorry about that. I’m friends with your old man.
Rintaro|I’m done here, so I’ll be going now.
Rintaro|So MayQueen exists...
Mayuri&Faris|Welcome back, Myaster♪
Rintaro|Faris... Mayuri...
Rintaro|Thank god...
Mayuri|No, Master! It’s Mayushii NyanNyan♪.
Mayuri|You’re Feris-chan’s Duel Partner, aren’t you?
Mayuri|Feris-chan, did you tell him Mayushii’s real name?
Faris|Hmmya? I don’t remember telling him, nya.
Faris|But you do call yourself Mayushii, so maybe he guessed, nya.
Mayuri|Oh! Ehehe!
Rintaro|...?
Faris|Kyouma!
Faris|Thanks for coming, nya. But please don’t act like my boyfriend in front of the customers, nya?
Rintaro|Your... boyfriend?
Faris|Dummy! You can’t use that word, nya! We can sweet talk all we want after work’s over, so control yourself until then, nya?
Rintaro|What are you talking about?
Faris|Nyanya? Oh, I see. You get it, nya. You’re one cool cat, nya.
Mayuri|C’mon, Feris-chan! You can’t flirt with him here!
Faris|Nyahaha. What do you mean, Mayushii? I did no such thing, nya.
Rintaro|Mayuri, do you remember Daru and Kurisu?
Mayuri|...?
Mayuri|Daru? Kurisu? Who?
Rintaro|Where’s our laboratory?
Mayuri|Laboratory?
Faris|Love hotel?
Rintaro|Ow. Ow! What are you doing!?
Faris|Kyouma! What’s this about, nya? Don’t tell me you made plans to meet Mayushii at a love hotel, nya?
Faris|Kyouma’s such a pervert to think about doing immoral things with a minor like her, nya.
Rintaro|Laboratory, not love hotel! Don’t mix them up!
Faris|Laboratory? What do you mean by laboratory, nya?
Rintaro|Laboratory. As in, the Future Gadget Laboratory...
Rintaro|You remember, don’t you, Mayuri? The Future Gadget Laboratory!
Mayuri|Um, Mayushii doesn’t know what that is. Sorry...
Faris|Anyway, why do you keep talking to Mayushii, nya? You trying to flirt right in front of your girlfriend, nya?
Rintaro|...
Faris|If that’s how you’re gonna be, then I’m gonna have to ask you leave, nya. So what’ll it be, nya?
Rintaro|R-right. Sorry...
Rintaro|Daru! There you are.
Itaru|Hey, what’s your relationship to Faris-tan?
Rintaro|What?
Itaru|I’ve seen you somewhere before. Where was it... Anyway, you’re being way too familiar with Faris-tan. Are you a filthy normal? You are, aren’t you?
Rintaro|Woah, Daru. Just what are you...
Rintaro|Have we met before?
Itaru|Course not. This is your first time here, right? As a regular customer, I make sure to remember the other customers’ faces.
Rintaro|No, I’m pretty sure I count as a regular here.
Itaru|This taste... is the taste of a liar.
Rintaro|How can you tell without even licking me?
Itaru|Anyway, answer me. What’s your relationship to Faris-tan?
Rintaro|I’m...
Itaru|Not direct enough? Fine. Question one. What is your name?
Rintaro|I’m... Hououin Kyouma.
Itaru|Seriously!?
Itaru|Oh, yeah! Yeah! Now I remember! I was sure I’d seen you somewhere before!
Itaru|You’re Faris-tan’s Duel Partner, Hououin-shi! Wow, I feel like an idiot!
Itaru|It’s an honor to meet you! I’m a big fan of you and Faris-tan! I saw that last semifinal!
Rintaro|Eh... hey, wait, Daru...?
Itaru|Daru? How do you know my nickname?
Rintaro|Ah, well...
Rintaro|I... see...
Itaru|Man, tomorrow’s the finals, huh! Beat the shit outta those Viral Attackers for me.
Rintaro|The finals...?
Rintaro|Hey... do you know someone named Makise Kurisu?
Itaru|Oh yeah, she’s that genius girl whose thesis got published in that big academic journal, right?
Rintaro|Have you met her?
Itaru|She gave a lecture at ATF a couple weeks back. I saw it. She was pretty cute, hehehe.
Itaru|Why do you ask?
Rintaro|Just wondering...
Faris|Papa...?
Faris|He went to work today, nya. What about him, nyan?
Rintaro|So your dad... is still alive?
Faris|Of course he is, nya. Why would you ask something like that, nya?
Faris|You’ve been acting weird today, nyan. What’s wrong, nya?
Rintaro|Nothing...
Rintaro|Is it true that you and I... are a couple?
Faris|Eh...
Faris|D-don’t tell me Kyouma was only playing with Faris, nya?
Faris|You’re terrible, nya... How could you play with the heart of a pure 17-year-old maiden!?
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|I won’t let you go anywhere.
Rintaro|I won’t let anyone take you away.
Rintaro|Hahaha...
Faris|Kyouma? What’s with this chuunibyou aura, nya!? We’re in the middle of an important conversation, nyan!
Rintaro|Hey, Faris... It looks like I have amnesia now...
Faris|That’s the world famous mad scientist for you, nya. Did the Organyaization land a headshot and make you lose your memories, nya?
Faris|Kyouma knew about the location of the stolen nyuclear weapons, and the Organization desperately tried to take back those memories, nya.
Rintaro|...
Faris|...Kyouma?
Faris|...
Rintaro|...
Faris|No way...
Faris|Really...?
Rintaro|Yeah...
Faris|So that’s why you’ve been acting strange, nya...
Faris|This is terrible, nya! Since when? What happened?
Rintaro|The worldline changed. Not like you’d understand what that means.
Rintaro|I’d call myself a space-time castaway.
Faris|This is no time for jokes, nya! This is a serious scene, nya! I’m worried about you, so answer me honestly, nyan!
Rintaro|Not one word I’ve said is a lie.
Rintaro|You of all people should know, right?
Faris|Well... yes, nya... but...
Rintaro|Please, tell me about our relationship. Tell me who I am.
Faris|You... really don’t remember?
Faris|Faris and Kyouma met at a RaiNet tournament, nya. It was at a small shop in Akiba, but as our life-or-death struggle unfolded, we understood each other’s hearts, nya.
Faris|Then we hit it off, and Faris and Kyouma became partners, nya.
Faris|We were a perfect match, and kept advancing even to the grand championships, hardly losing a single match, nya.
Faris|And then... as we fought side by side, Faris... started to want to know more about Kyouma... I couldn’t stop thinking about you...
Faris|That’s when Faris began... to fall in love with Kyouma, nya...
Faris|I wanted to be together as partners, not only in RaiNet, but in private, too, nyan...
Faris|So, after we won that last semifinal, I made up my mind and confessed, nya.
Faris|And when Kyouma said he loved me too... we shared a sweet kiss, and officially became lovers, nya.
Faris|By the way, Faris and Kyouma live together, nya.
Rintaro|WHAT!?
Faris|Actually, Kyouma’s just staying over for summer break while we prepare for the RaiNet championship, nya.
Faris|So, um, we haven’t done anything naughty yet, nya...
Faris|Wait, what are you making me say, nyaaa!?
Faris|Do you remember yet, nya?
Rintaro|Faris. I have a favor to ask.
Faris|Nya? What is it, nya? I’ll do anything if it helps you remember, nya.
Rintaro|No, it’s not about my memories... it’s about Mayuri.
Faris|Mayushii? Come to think of it, you were awfully chatty with her, nya...
Rintaro|Tonight, around 8 PM... Mayuri might die.
Faris|Eh...!?
Rintaro|Can you keep an eye on her?
Faris|She might die? But... you’ve gotta be joking this time, nya?
Rintaro|I’m telling the truth.
Faris|...
Rintaro|She might die, or she might not. I’d say it’s fifty-fifty.
Rintaro|You don’t have to do anything. Just keep an eye on her, and tell me what happens.
Rintaro|Can you do that?
Faris|I don’t understand, nya...
Faris|But...
Faris|But Faris loves Kyouma. I love you a lot.
Faris|So I trust you, nya. I trust you.
Rintaro|Thank you.
Faris’ Dad|Okabe-kun.
Faris’ Dad|Is Rumiho still working?
Rintaro|No. She went out with a friend from work.
Faris’ Dad|I see. It’s not good for a high school student to be out this late.
Faris’ Dad|You need to warn her, Okabe-kun.
Rintaro|Understood.
Faris’ Dad|Sorry I have such a troublesome daughter. I hope she’s not too hard to deal with.
Faris’ Dad|I want you to know, I have great respect for you.
Rintaro|Thank you very much.
Faris’ Dad|Sorry about this, but my wife and I have to fly overseas for a business trip.
Faris’ Dad|Kuroki will be here, so just ask him if you need anything.
Faris’ Dad|Well then. We’re off.
Rintaro|Take care.
Faris|I’m home♪
Faris|That was fun!
Rintaro|Faris! Why didn’t you contact me? What happened to Mayuri?
Faris|Nothing happened to Mayushii, nyan. We sang anime songs for about two hours, and then I took her home, nya.
Faris|I was such a gentleman, nya. I think I might have raised some yuri flags, nyan. Nyahaha.
Rintaro|I see...
Faris|Kyouma? Are you going to sleep, nya?
Rintaro|Yeah, just let me... rest a bit...
Faris|Next turn. Your move, nya.
Rintaro|Gah! It’s a little early, but I guess I should use a Terminal Card and turn the tables... no, this has to be a trap...
Faris|What you do is up to you, nyan.
Rintaro|Wait. Wait! There’s no problem my mighty brain cells can’t handle...
Rintaro|Alright. After careful consideration, I use Virus Checker.
Faris|Nice try, nya. But Faris has plans and backup plans to counter you, nyan.
Rintaro|What... you say?
Faris|Now Kyouma’s server is fully exposed, nya. I use this Terminal Card to pounce on you, nyan.
Rintaro|Gh. Another loss... That’s 19 losses out of 19 matches. I’m a disgrace to mad scientists everywhere...
Faris|...
Faris|Kyouma... you really did forget RaiNet’s art of war, nya...
Faris|It didn’t feel like Kyouma lost his memories for real until now...
Faris|I didn’t think you’d be this poopy, nya...
Faris|Did Kyouma forget everything about Faris too, nya?
Rintaro|Not everything. I just... don’t have a single memory of us as a couple.
Faris|Hnnyaa...
Faris|That means you don’t love me anymore, nya...
Rintaro|...
Faris|T-then there’s only one thing to do!
Faris|I’ll make your body remember, nyan!
Rintaro|...gh!?
Rintaro|A-are you going to assault me!?
Faris|T-that’s certainly an option, nya... but this is my first time, so I want to do it gently, nyan.
Rintaro|Calm down! If it’s the first time, then the how the hell will my body remember it!?
Faris|Kyoumaaa, nyauuuun.
Faris|Papa and Mama went overseas, nya. Kuroki’s gone home too, nya.
Faris|We have this whole apartment to ourselves, nya.
Faris|What will you do, nya? Even without your memories, can you really resist me, nya?
Rintaro|I won’t be tempted, catgirl!
Faris|Kyoumaa! Kyoumakyoumakyouma!
Faris|Sniff...
Rintaro|Faris...?
Faris|You not remembering... hurts so much, nya...
Rintaro|...
Faris|The person I knew became someone I don’t know...
Faris|I can remember things we did together from before, but you have no recollection...
Faris|I can’t bring those memories back...
Faris|It hurts so much... I wish I’d lost my memories too, nya...
Rintaro|But this...
Rintaro|This is my choice.
Faris|Your choice?
Rintaro|Yeah.
Rintaro|I’m glad I have you, Faris. I want you to know that.
Rintaro|I don’t remember falling in love...
Rintaro|But I’m glad that we did.
Faris|Kyouma...
Rintaro|You’re the only person who knows me here, Faris.
Rintaro|As long as we’re together, everything will be fine.
Rintaro|I hope you’ll stay with me, even now.
Rintaro|I probably won’t get my memories back...
Rintaro|But I want to fall in love with you all over again.
Faris|Kyouma... Faris wants you... to take off her cat ears, nya.
Faris|Will you... call me Rumiho?
Rintaro|Rumiho.
Faris|Will you... kiss me?
Faris|Mm...
Faris|You’re my prince, you know?
Faris|Is it okay if I still love you?
Rintaro|Yeah.
Faris|Yay.
Announcer|Thanks for waiting, everyone! Very soon, we will start the finals and see once and for all, who is the RaiNet AccessBattlers Grand Champion!
Faris|Kyouma, are you sure you’ll be fine, nya?
Rintaro|I’ve decided. This is my home now.
Rintaro|Besides, the Viral Attackers are a troublesome opponent, win or lose.
Rintaro|I have to protect you from them.
Faris|I’m so happy, nya.
Faris|Together.
Rintaro|Yeah. Together.
Faris|Kyouma? Do you know where Faris’s phone went, nya?
Rintaro|Here’s your phone.
Faris|Nya?
Faris|Kyouma... did you see what was inside, nya?
Rintaro|...
Faris|If you did see it, then please forget about it, nya. Can’t let that cat out of the bag, nya. Or else they will awaken, nya...
Rintaro|...
Faris|Come on, Kyouma! You’re supposed to say something, nya! Like ’who the hell are they!?’ or something, nya!
Rintaro|...I’m sorry.
Faris|Kyouma’s acting weird, nya. You usually act all pompous and--nya!?
Rintaro|I’m sorry.
Faris|Kyouma? T-this is really bold of you, nya... Mayushii’s in the next room. She’ll find out, you know? Nyahaha...
Rintaro|I’m sorry...
Rintaro|They’re back...
Luka|Yes, who is... ah, Okabe-san.
Rintaro|Lukako, someone should have donated an old computer to the shrine several years ago. Can you ask your dad about it for me?
Luka|An... old computer?
Luka|Um, I’ll go call my dad.
Luka’s Father|Well, if it isn’t Hououin-kun. Thank you for taking care of my daughter.
Rintaro|If I’m not mistaken, there was an old computer donated to this shrine about ten years ago. Do you know about it?
Luka’s Father|An old computer... why, yes, I do remember that.
Rintaro|Really!?
Rintaro|Please, I need to see it!
Luka’s Father|Sure. Please wait here.
Luka|...
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Are you afraid of me, Lukako?
Luka|Eh?
Rintaro|I understand. I mean, I uh... touched your, uh, naughty bits, I guess...
Luka|...
Luka|I’m not... afraid of you, Okabe-san...
Luka|That was really... embarrassing, though...
Rintaro|Sorry.
Luka|Okay...
Rintaro|By the way, do you know about the IBN 5100?
Luka|N-no!
Luka|I’ve... never heard of it.
Rintaro|But when I called you before, it sounded like you knew about it.
Luka|No, I...
Rintaro|So, uh... you’re not gonna wear the costume Mayuri made?
Luka|Oh... no...
Rintaro|Because it’s embarrassing?
Luka|Yes...
Luka’s Father|That’s strange...
Rintaro|Did you find it?
Luka’s Father|Well... I couldn’t find it.
Rintaro|You couldn’t find it?
Luka’s Father|I remember receiving an old computer, but it’s not in the storehouse anymore.
Rintaro|...Pardon my asking, but the PC was donated by Akiha Rumiho-san, correct?
Luka’s Father|Huh, how did you know? Do you know her by chance?
Rintaro|We’re friends.
Luka’s Father|Rumiho-chan has grown up to be a splendid young lady, hasn’t she?
Luka’s Father|It was when she was still in elementary school. She came to visit with her butler, Kuroki-san.
Luka’s Father|But why did that computer disappear? I thought someone might have stolen it, but everything else is untouched, and the lock wasn’t broken.
Luka’s Father|Luka, do you know anything about it? You’ve been cleaning the sanctuary the past few years, haven’t you?
Luka|...
Rintaro|Lukako, what’s wrong?
Luka|...I don’t know anything.
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Welcome backarin.
Rintaro|Who is this ’Karin’?
Mayuri|Well, ’welcome back’ flows so well into ’Okarin,’ doesn’t it? When you put them together, it’s doubly delicious.
Rintaro|It’s not delicious.
Mayuri|It’s a greeting I can only use for Okarin, so why not? Ehehe!
Rintaro|Where’s Daru?
Mayuri|Hmm, probably at MayQueen?
Rintaro|MayQueen...
Rintaro|So when Faris said she had work, she meant at MayQueen...
Rintaro|What about you, Mayuri? You work there too, don’t you?
Mayuri|’Course I do! You know that, Okarin. You’re so weird!
Mayuri|Mayushii’s taking a break to prepare for ComiMa tomorrow.
Kurisu|Okabe? What are you doing? I thought we weren’t going to--
Rintaro|Whew...
Rintaro|Hello? Daru?
Itaru|Haa, ugh, gh, haah...
Rintaro|Hey, what happened!? Daru!?
Itaru|I’m sor... some guys... came out of nowhere... they took Mayu-shi...
Itaru|I think... they wanted... me...
Itaru|I... ran... but Mayu-shi...
Itaru|What do I do, Okarin!?
Rintaro|I won’t let you kill Mayuri!
Rintaro|Whew...
Kurisu|This seems serious.
Rintaro|Yes. I have a difficult problem that requires... delicacy to resolve.
Kurisu|Delicacy? That’s like the exact opposite of what anyone expects from you.
Rintaro|That’s why I want to ask a girl. Plus, you’re my assistant, so I need you to save my ass this instant.
Kurisu|Oh, you.
Kurisu|Why do you need to ask a girl anyway?
Kurisu|Urushibara-san is actually a guy? That’s totally ridiculous.
Rintaro|But it’s the truth. Was the truth.
Kurisu|So basically, umm...
Kurisu|She looked like Hashida?
Rintaro|...
Rintaro & Kurisu|Ugh.
Kurisu|Unacceptable! There’s no way such a cute girl was a guy.
Rintaro|Hey, hold your horses. I never said that Lukako looked like a guy.
Rintaro|He actually looked pretty much the same. He was always androgynous, so much you couldn’t help but think he was secreting excess female hormones or something.
Kurisu|He looked like she does now?
Kurisu|Acceptable.
Kurisu|Anyway. You want to turn her back into a guy?
Rintaro|Unless we do, Mayuri dies.
Kurisu|Mayuri’s life is tied to Urushibara-san’s gender... That’s so crazy it doesn’t seem real at all.
Kurisu|Have you come up with a solution?
Rintaro|Of course. I’ll have Lukako turn back into a guy.
Kurisu|I don’t know if she’s going to appreciate that.
Rintaro|That’s why I’m consulting you, so I can find a way to do this while hurting her the least.
Rintaro|...If only I hadn’t been so careless.
Rintaro|I shouldn’t have let so many people send D-Mails.
Kurisu|Regret won’t change anything.
Kurisu|There’s only one piece of advice I can give.
Kurisu|Don’t say anything to Urushibara-san.
Rintaro|What do you mean?
Kurisu|Based on what you’ve told me, you have the advantage this time. You already know the contents of the D-Mail.
Kurisu|So you don’t have to tell her -- him? Ex-him?
Kurisu|...You don’t have to tell Urushibara-san. Just send the cancellation D-Mail.
Rintaro|You mean pose as Lukako and send the mail to her mother myself?
Kurisu|If the worldline changes, then that will all be undone.
Kurisu|In which case, ethical concerns don’t really matter.
Rintaro|Just one problem.
Rintaro|I don’t know her mother’s pager number.
Kurisu|What!? Are you an idiot!? Why didn’t you write it down!?
Rintaro|I didn’t think I would need it!
Kurisu|What if you just ask for the pager number directly? Think up a good excuse.
Rintaro|That’s going to look suspicious...
Kurisu|What are you so scared of? That’s not the vain and arrogant Okabe I know.
Kurisu|Just make up some nonsense like you always do. I mean, you know how gullible she is, right?
Kurisu|...Wow, I hate myself for saying that. I’m a bad girl.
Rintaro|Maybe I should just tell her the truth. Sincerity will work better than underhanded tricks... I think.
Kurisu|A mad scientist, sincere? That’s a good one.
Kurisu|It’s more like you to say ’I’ll brainwash her, muhahaha!’.
Rintaro|I will shoulder Lukako’s pain. That’s my responsibility.
Rintaro|When I cancel that D-Mail, the fact that she was a girl will be undone.
Rintaro|I’m the only one who can carry that burden.
Kurisu|So what are you talking to me for? Go to her now, and tell her what you told me.
Rintaro|Yeah... you’re right.
Luka|Ah, Okabe-san...
Luka|I-I’m sorry, I left Samidare in my room...
Rintaro|No, that’s okay.
Luka|R-really?
Luka|Is... something wrong?
Rintaro|W-well...
Rintaro|Lukako!
Luka|Uh, yes!?
Rintaro|Please listen carefully. The truth is...
Rintaro|You used to be a guy.
Luka|You’re... saying that again? Sniff...
Rintaro|Listen! Unless you turn back into a guy... Mayuri will die.
Luka|Eh...
Luka|You’re... joking, right?
Luka|I can’t... believe any of it...
Luka|This is more roleplaying, right? You’re being Kyouma-san, right? Right?
Luka|I don’t like that backstory. It hurts... and I think it would hurt Mayuri-chan too...
Rintaro|I know you’re confused, hearing this so suddenly. But it’s all true. I’ve witnessed her death countless times.
Rintaro|I’m sorry. I know I’m being selfish. But I’m begging you. To save Mayuri... I need you to become a guy again.
Luka|Please tell me you’re joking, Okabe-san...
Luka|I can’t possibly be a guy... I don’t want to be...
Luka|I’ve always been a girl... ever since I was born. This is cruel.
Luka|And why do I have to hear it... from you, of all people?
Luka|I’m so embarrassed... sniff... this isn’t right...
Rintaro|What’s to be embarrassed about? I have a harder time thinking of you as a girl anyway.
Luka|...that’s how... you... of me...
Rintaro|What? I couldn’t hear you.
Luka|So that’s how you think of me...
Rintaro|Lukako! Wait!!
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|You raised a flag.
Rintaro|What are you talking about?
Kurisu|Don’t you get it? You raised a flag. Or I guess you could say you tripped over a flag that was already raised.
Rintaro|You mean a death flag?
Kurisu|Why!? It’s a romance flag, genius.
Rintaro|Wha...!
Kurisu|Urushibara-san likes you.
Kurisu|When her beloved Hououin Kyouma told her she was a guy, it tore her pure maidenly heart into tiny little pieces.
Kurisu|In other words, your plan was a massive failure.
Kurisu|Love is trouble. There’s no formula for calculating people’s feelings. Too many unknowns to solve for.
Kurisu|The direct approach was a mistake. It’ll be even harder to persuade her now.
Kurisu|You should think of another way this time. Like asking her mother directly.
Kurisu|Though I’m sure the Urushibara family already thinks of you as the man who made their daughter cry. So they might have their guard up.
Rintaro|Um... when do you think I first set off that romance flag?
Kurisu|How should I know?
Rintaro|I mean, think about it. Lukako was a guy last week. If he already liked me at that point, then...
Kurisu|That’s just your perspective.
Kurisu|From everyone else’s perspective, she was always a girl. It makes perfect sense.
Kurisu|Think in terms of the current worldline.
Kurisu|Anyway, there’s a bigger problem.
Kurisu|Will changing Urushibara-san’s gender to male really bring the IBN 5100 back?
Rintaro|Something is different from the previous worldline.
Rintaro|According to Lukako’s father, the IBN 5100 was definitely at Yanabayashi Shrine.
Rintaro|Suzuha gave it to Faris’s dad. After he died, Faris donated it to Yanabayashi Shrine...
Rintaro|That sequence is the same as on the worldline where I obtain the IBN 5100.
Kurisu|So you’re gradually approaching the original worldline.
Kurisu|You know, I’ve been thinking. You really shouldn’t be able to change the worldline so easily.
Rintaro|What makes you say that?
Kurisu|I mean, there are six billion people in the world.
Kurisu|It doesn’t make sense that switching a single person’s gender could cause such a huge change in the worldline.
Rintaro|According to Suzuha, taking different actions after a time leap will only change divergence by around 0.000001%, if at all.
Rintaro|But when I canceled Faris’s D-Mail, there was a 0.05% change.
Kurisu|0.05% is pretty big.
Kurisu|What did Amane-san have to say about that?
Rintaro|The year 2010 is a major attractor field junction, and the key is whether or not I obtain an IBN 5100.
Kurisu|Maybe the divergence meter actually measures your distance to the IBN 5100...
Kurisu|In any case, what you’re saying is that all of the D-Mails we sent had an influence on the IBN 5100’s location somehow?
Rintaro|There were also some D-Mails that didn’t activate Reading Steiner.
Kurisu|Hmmm. So just cancel the D-Mails that activated Reading Steiner, and the IBN 5100 might come back to you.
Rintaro|...Kiryu Moeka.
Rintaro|So what should I do about Lukako?
Kurisu|Well, you tripped a romance flag, so...
Kurisu|Hmm...
Kurisu|...Ah!
Kurisu|B-by the way, Okabe. Is there... someone you like?
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|Wh-why aren’t you answering?
Rintaro|Not really.
Kurisu|Oh... okay.
Rintaro|Why do you ask?
Kurisu|Ah, no, just wondering! There’s no hidden meaning, okay!?
Rintaro|Why are you mad? Also, your face is red.
Kurisu|Is not!
Kurisu|A-anyway! You should go out with Urushibara-san!
Rintaro|...Seriously?
Kurisu|Y-you don’t like anyone else, right? Then answer her feelings, you dummy.
Rintaro|Mayuri dies in two days. I don’t have time to play boyfriend.
Kurisu|Just go out with her.
Rintaro|...Seriously?
Kurisu|If there’s nobody you like, then there’s no reason not to, is there?
Kurisu|Get close and help her work through her feelings. Then she’ll probably tell you what you need to know.
Rintaro|Mayuri dies in two days. I don’t have time for that touchy-feely stuff.
Kurisu|...Only consider this as a last resort.
Kurisu|If you’re willing to hurt Urushibara-san, you can always take the information by force.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|She’ll forget after the worldline changes, won’t she? In that case, I think it’s a valid option.
Kurisu|But only when compared to Mayuri’s death.
Kurisu|...I hate myself for suggesting this.
Rintaro|No, you’re right. I need to consider every possible option.
Rintaro|But I don’t want to do that if there’s any other choice.
Mayuri|Okarin? Ah, there you are!
Rintaro|You’re early. It’s still eight. Something happening today?
Mayuri|I’m here to scold you, Okarin!
Mayuri|Mayushii’s very disappointed in you!
Rintaro|What did I do?
Mayuri|You can’t fool me, Okarin. You made Luka-chan cry, didn’t you?
Rintaro|H-how did you...
Mayuri|Luka-chan told me. She said you said she was a guy.
Rintaro|Damn...
Mayuri|Why would you say such a mean thing, Okarin?
Rintaro|M-Mayuri, it doesn’t involve you. This is a serious, confidential matter involving the Organization--
Mayuri|It does too involve me. Luka-chan is Mayushii’s friend!
Mayuri|If you don’t tell me, we’re not friends anymore, okay? I’m gonna quit being a lab mem!
Mayuri|Why did you say such a mean thing?
Mayuri|...You’re worried about something, aren’t you?
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|I can tell. I’ve been watching you longer than anyone, Okarin...
Mayuri|And yesterday, you talked with Chris-chan for a looong time, didn’t you?
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|If something’s wrong, you should talk to Mayushii too, okay?
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|I want to help too... okay? Now, let’s go apologize to Luka-chan. Will you do that for me? Mayushii will come too, so let’s--
Rintaro|Heh... heh heh heh, muhahahaha!
Mayuri|O-Okarin?
Rintaro|Come now, Mayuri. Me, worry? Don’t be ridiculous!
Rintaro|I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma! I have nothing to worry about!
Rintaro|All I have... is the hunger for chaos! Muhahahaha!
Mayuri|Okarin...
Rintaro|Alright...
Mayuri|Where are you going? Mayushii’s not done talking.
Rintaro|I’m going to Lukako’s.
Mayuri|Really? You’re going to apologize? Then let Mayushii come too!
Rintaro|No, that will just make it harder.
Rintaro|Please, take care of the lab while I’m gone.
Rintaro|...Ahem.
Luka|You came...
Luka|Thank you.
Rintaro|What did you tell Mayuri?
Luka|...S-sorry. But Mayuri-chan’s the only one I could talk to about this.
Rintaro|I mean, how much did you tell her?
Luka|I kept most of it a secret. Especially the stuff about her dying...
Rintaro|Do you still think I’m joking?
Rintaro|Umm, you said you had something important to talk about, nya?
Luka|...Um.
Luka|I...
Rintaro|Y-yes?
Luka|...want to ask...
Rintaro|Yes?
Luka|...
Luka|Okabe-san... about what you said yesterday...
Rintaro|Yeah.
Luka|I... believe you.
Rintaro|T-that’s great!
Luka|...so, well...
Luka|In exchange... for becoming a guy again...
Luka|For today... and tomorrow...
Luka|We can stop... before Mayuri-chan is in danger...
Luka|...so...
Luka|Please be my...
Rintaro|...Hm? I couldn’t hear you. One more time.
Luka|Please be my b...end
Rintaro|Speak up. I’ll do anything I can.
Luka|Boy...end...
Rintaro|What?
Luka|P-please be my boyfriend!
Rintaro|Wh-why?
Luka|I...
Luka|...like you.
Luka|...
Rintaro|...
Luka|...
Rintaro|...
Luka|...
Rintaro|L-let me think about it! Give me two -- no, five minutes!
Mayuri|Okarin! How’d it go?
Mayuri|Did you apologize to Luka-chan?
Rintaro|Uh, yeah. So put the Juicy Chicken Number One in the microwave and nuke it so that the D-Mail’s basically ABC and...
Mayuri|Huwha?
Rintaro|The microwave was developed by knights of the Rosicrucian Order who used alchemy. Meaning that the sound of the chime is the brainwashing device, while the chime itself actually doesn’t have any meaning at all...
Mayuri|Waaah, Okarin’s broken!
Mayuri|What are you doing?
Rintaro|M-making a tactical retreat.
Mayuri|Retreat...?
Kurisu|Stop staring. You’re distracting me. How many times do I have to tell you?
Rintaro|Genius neuroscientist, I need to talk to you.
Kurisu|Make it short.
Rintaro|I want you to come with me to Yanabayashi Shrine.
Kurisu|Tell me why. If it’s a date or something, then I refuse.
Rintaro|H-Hououin Kyouma does not go on dates. Much less with his assistant. Ridiculous.
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|S-so... I need you to explain the differences between the male brain and the female brain.
Kurisu|What.
Luka|Okabe-san... and Makise-san. Did you come to pray?
Kurisu|A-ahem. Actually, we have something to talk to you about, Urushibara-san.
Luka|What might that be?
Kurisu|Did you know? Male and female brains are very different.
Luka|What...?
Kurisu|Male brains are right-dominant. Female brains are left-dominant.
Luka|Y-yeah...?
Kurisu|By the way, the right brain handles image processing, spacial processing, and comprehensive judgment. The left brain handles things like language, and calculation.
Kurisu|The right and left brains are connected by the corpus callosum, which is more developed in females.
Kurisu|You know how people say that girls are better at multitasking? That can be explained by the development of the corpus callosum.
Luka|Uh... what...?
Kurisu|Actually, these theories are kinda fringe. They’re not really that credible.
Kurisu|So if you don’t mind, I’d like to do an experiment.
Luka|A-an experiment?
Kurisu|I want to try mapping your brain patterns to see if they’re more female or male.
Luka|What is mapping...?
Kurisu|Brainwave mapping. We just take a sample of your brainwaves. Anyway, you’ll understand if you try it. Okay? Okay? It won’t hurt a bit.
Luka|N-no thanks...
Kurisu|It’ll be okay, I promise. It won’t hurt a bit. Just come to the lab and we’ll--
Rintaro|What kind of perverted old man are you!?
Kurisu|Fwahn! Wh-what!?
Rintaro|Don’t you what me! What did we come here for!? What are you going to do if you scare Lukako away!?
Kurisu|I’m just treating her like a valuable test sub--
Rintaro|Go back to the lab, you experiment-loving girl!
Kurisu|Yeah, okay. So that’s the thanks I get for going out of my way to help you. I’m gone. You’re on your own now.
Luka|Um... what was Makise-san talking about?
Rintaro|Well, basically...
Rintaro|Y-you’re actually a guy.
Mayuri|Okarin? There you are!
Mayuri|Mayushii’s very disappointed in you!
Mayuri|You made Luka-chan cry, didn’t you?
Mayuri|Luka-chan told me. She said you said she was a guy.
Mayuri|Why would you say such a mean thing, Okarin?
Rintaro|...I’m going to see her now, so don’t worry.
Mayuri|R-really? Thank goodness. If you weren’t gonna apologize, then Mayushii was never gonna talk to you again.
Luka|P-please be my boyfriend!
Rintaro|Christina! Christina!
Mayuri|Is Chris-chan sleeping? She worked all night, so you shouldn’t wake her up.
Rintaro|Christina! Please wake up!
Kurisu|...Oh, shut up.
Mayuri|Chris-chan, tutturu♪
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|What is it?
Rintaro|I’m going to Yanabayashi Shrine. Come with me.
Rintaro|It’s time for Operation Christina II.
Luka|Until... the 15th...
Luka|We can stop... before Mayuri-chan is in danger...
Luka|...so...
Luka|Please be my...
Rintaro|...
Luka|Please be my b...end...
Rintaro|...
Luka|Boy...end...
Rintaro|...
Luka|P-please be my boyfriend!
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|E-excuse me. I need a moment.
Kurisu|Sup, you filthy normal?
Rintaro|Who’s a normal? Think about how I feel for once.
Rintaro|Did you hear what Lukako said just now?
Kurisu|No. Fill me in.
Rintaro|You weren’t listening!?
Kurisu|How am I supposed to listen from all the way over here?
Rintaro|She confessed. Until the 15th. Then back to manhood.
Kurisu|Roger.
Kurisu|And? Why are you asking me? Just grant Urushibara-san’s wish.
Rintaro|B-but it’s Lukako!
Kurisu|What’s wrong with her? I mean, look how cute she is.
Rintaro|But she’s a--
Kurisu|Her being a guy might just be your imagination.
Kurisu|From my perspective, she’s always been a girl.
Rintaro|Gh...
Kurisu|Just give up. Bye.
Rintaro|Ah, wai--
Rintaro|Damn! Why did I even bring her along?
Luka|Um... were you on the phone... with Makise-san?
Rintaro|Hm? Oh, yeah...
Luka|Oh...
Luka|You looked like you were having fun...
Rintaro|N-nonsense.
Luka|So...
Luka|Your... answer...
Rintaro|...Very well.
Luka|Eh...?
Rintaro|I’ll go out with you. But only until the 15th.
Luka|Ah...
Rintaro|Wh-why are you crying!?
Luka|Sniff... I’m h-happy...
Luka|I was sure that you’d say no...
Luka|Thank goodness... thank goodness... sniff...
Rintaro|...
Luka|...Um, Okabe-san?
Rintaro|Wh-what!?
Luka|Um... tomorrow... a da...
Luka|...
Luka|Please... take me... on a date.
Rintaro|What...did you say...?
Rintaro|Okay, but where?
Luka|Eh...
Luka|I want to go where you want to go, Okabe-san...
Luka|Um, I want to know more about the places you frequent, Okabe-san...
Rintaro|...Then I’ll come up with something by tomorrow.
Kurisu|Well?
Kurisu|Did you agree to go out with her? Well, I can kind of guess based on Urushibara-san’s reaction.
Rintaro|Wait, you saw that!?
Kurisu|You told me to watch, didn’t you?
Rintaro|...We’re going on a date tomorrow.
Kurisu|Yeah?
Kurisu|Our insane mad scientist is dating a high school girl. That’s not insane at all.
Rintaro|Gh...
Rintaro|What was that for!?
Kurisu|Sorry. I didn’t mean to be snippy. I’m just a little irritated.
Kurisu|You made this choice to save Mayuri. So I’ll change my way of thinking too.
Kurisu|Anyway, do you have any plans for your date tomorrow?
Kurisu|Well, do you?
Rintaro|...I have only one thing to say, assistant mine.
Rintaro|I am the great Hououin Kyouma, a mad scientist with an IQ rivaling that of Isaac Newton himself!
Kurisu|And?
Rintaro|Naturally, as a mad scientist, I have no interest in this thing mortals call love. My incredible brain is devoted to the destruction of the System that controls the world, and the birth of a new age of chaos!
Kurisu|You’re obviously a virgin, thank you ver--
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...Hah!?
Kurisu|...P-pretend you didn’t just hear that.
Rintaro|Damn you, assistant! How dare you point out the truth so bluntly! I won’t forget this insult!
Kurisu|S-sorry...
Rintaro|And what about you!? Your experience must be vast indeed if you think you can lecture me about it!
Kurisu|Ugh...
Rintaro|That’s what I thought! You spend all your time on research, so you’ve got zero experience, don’t you!? You must’ve been awfully lonely in America, huh!?
Kurisu|Shut up! What’s wrong with being a virgin!?
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...Hah!?
Kurisu|Ah... awhawha...
Rintaro|The genius girl who cried ’virgin’ at the center of Akiba...
Kurisu|L-let’s get out of here!
Kurisu|What’s important for a first date is to make a good impression.
Kurisu|An unclean appearance is out of the question. A haircut is especially important. Long hair looks dirty, so it’s no good.
Kurisu|For clothes, you should wear something exactly the right size. Though it may be trendy, especially in Akiba, for young men to wear baggy clothes, it looks sloppy, so it’s not good.
Kurisu|On the first date, conversation tends to break due to mutual nervousness. What’s important is to play ’conversation catch’.
Kurisu|One-sided conversations aren’t fun for the other side. Girls especially like to talk, so the guy should try to keep the conversation going.
Kurisu|Not just by listening. Throwing in appropriate responses is also necessary. Responsiveness gives the girl the impression that you’re really listening to her.
Kurisu|Basically, you need to be the opposite of yourself.
Kurisu|Anyway, focus on acting normal for now. No more of that idiotic laughter.
Kurisu|You’re too heavy-handed with girls. You talk too pompously. You fire off nonsensical delusions.
Rintaro|Hey! You’re just reading out of a dating manual, so you’ve got no right to look down on me, you American virgin!
Kurisu|Who are you calling an American virgin?
Rintaro|Who else but you?
Kurisu|Yeah, sure thing, virgin.
Kurisu|There’s a saying. ’A fortress is judged by how many attacks it repulses; a soldier is judged by how many fortresses he takes.’
Rintaro|That’s not a saying. Don’t look so proud of yourself.
Kurisu|...You’re right. This is a dumb argument.
Kurisu|Anyway, this dating manual actually says some pretty interesting things.
Kurisu|Like ’when walking down the street, be sure to put yourself between your date and the road’ or ’whatever you do, don’t make the girl pay for anything’. Okay! For your date tomorrow, make sure you follow all of these rules.
Kurisu|And after that, there’s... carry a clean handkerchief. Spread it out when the girl goes to sit on a park bench.
Rintaro|I’m not her butler.
Kurisu|But that’s what the book says.
Kurisu|When it’s time to eat, avoid fast food of all kinds. Family restaurants are borderline acceptable. Anything else depends on your budget.
Rintaro|Family restaurants are borderline...
Kurisu|Arrive at the meeting place at least 15 minutes early. Tardiness is unacceptable.
Rintaro|15 minutes early...
Kurisu|Then you just need to decide where to take her. Movies, art galleries, strolling through town, and food are all safe.
Rintaro|I see. It’s easier than I thought.
Rintaro|I was under the impression that a first date required going to a beautiful beach resort, exchanging your first kiss bathed in the light of the setting sun, and stuff like that.
Kurisu|Ah, that’s really romantic!
Kurisu|...I mean, that’s virgin imagination at full throttle. You’ve read too much manga.
Rintaro|You too.
Kurisu|Besides, your date’s a minor, so don’t even think about bringing her to a hotel, okay?
Rintaro|...What do you take me for?
Kurisu|That just about covers it. Well? Was my lecture helpful?
Rintaro|You mean the manual’s lecture.
Faris|Nyanya? Kyouma, are you going on a date, nya?
Faris|Thanks for waiting! I’ll prepare your iced coffee, nyan♪
Faris|Is Mayushii the lucky girl, nya?
Rintaro|Why would you think that?
Faris|Hmmya? Not her, nya? Then...
Faris|Is it her, nya?
Kurisu|Hwehh...!
Rintaro|No, she’s my assistant.
Kurisu|...
Faris|Then some other girl, nya? Kyouma, you tomcat, you’re making moves on too many girls, nya.
Kurisu|Oh-ho... So you’re making moves on too many girls, huh?
Rintaro|What nonsense.
Luka|So... where to next?
Rintaro|How about we take a walk around town?
Luka|Eh? Um, okay.
Luka|...
Luka|Um... Okabe-san.
Rintaro|Yeah?
Luka|...Do you remember?
Luka|About the first time you and I met.
Rintaro|...Yeah.
Luka|P-please stop... I can’t...
Low-Angler A|P-please, let me take just one photo.
Low-Angler B|That cosplay is super moe. I’ve never seen such a cute miko cosplayer before.
Luka|Th-this isn’t cosplay...
Low-Angler A|If you could make a cute pose, I’d be su-super happy.
Low-Angler B|D-do that thing, you know, that thing Megumi-tan does in Miko Miko Overdrive.
Low-Angler A|Yeah! That would be awesome! You know Megumi-tan, right? Can you do it for us?
Luka|I-I don’t know, sorry...
Low-Angler B|What’s wrong? If you come to Akiba in cosplay, that means you want people to take your picture, right?
Low-Angler A|That’s right. Or are you rejecting us ’cause we’re losers?
Luka|N-no... it’s just... this isn’t cosplay...
Rintaro|You with the cameras!
Low-Angler A|Eh?
Low-Angler B|Wh-who are you...
Rintaro|Heh! Who am I? I am the great Hououin Kyouma, bearer of the mightiest brain since Einstein himself, the insane mad scientist who will bring chaos to the world! Muhahaha! 
Low-Angler A|Wh-what’s with this guy?
Low-Angler B|He’s nuts.
Rintaro|Stop right there. This miko clearly does not want your attention!
Low-Angler A|G-get out of here, chuunibyou!
Low-Angler B|You trying to be cool and save a girl for smex in return? You’re just another pervert!
Rintaro|Look in the mirror when you say that. You’re the ones harassing this frail girl, forcing her to take perverted pictures. Have you no otaku pride?
Luka|Um, I’m a...
Rintaro|A cameraman who frightens a sacred miko is no cameraman at all! He’s nothing but lowlife scum, unfit to walk the holy streets of Akiba! 
Low-Angler A|Wh-what!? Everyone’s aiming for low-angle shots of cute 3D girls!
Low-Angler B|Amateur cosplayers should take what they get. When you cosplay in Akiba, you’re asking to get photographed! That’s how it works.
Luka|N-no... I... I’m...
Luka|A guy!
Luka|So... there’s no point in photographing me...
Low-Angler A|R-really?
Low-Angler B|No way. Someone this cute can’t be a guy...
Luka|I am a guy.... I even have an Adam’s apple...
Low-Angler A|Then, you’ve got one down there, too?
Luka|...
Low-Angler B|Wh-what the hell? This is fraud!
Low-Angler A|What kind of guy wears miko robes? You some kinda pervert?
Low-Angler B|Thank god I didn’t take a picture! I feel tricked.
Luka|Um, thank you very much...
Rintaro|Hm? Nah, it’s nothing.
Luka|But you’re disappointed that you saved a guy, aren’t you?
Luka|I’m sorry... I can’t live up to your expectations.
Rintaro|...What’s your name?
Luka|Eh? Urushibara... Luka.
Rintaro|Why are you apologizing?
Luka|I mean... I look like this... but I’m a guy...
Rintaro|It matters not!
Luka|...!?
Rintaro|It doesn’t matter if you’re a guy or a girl! We need to work on that inferiority complex of yours.
Luka|Eh? Eh...?
Rintaro|Come with me! I shall bestow upon you a mighty gift! An item that will give you courage. I’m sure you, too, have noticed the true power that sleeps inside of you.
Luka|Eh? Ehhh?
Rintaro|What’s wrong? You desire power... don’t you?
Luka|Umm... p-power?
Rintaro|Indeed. I can grant you power. All you need is the will, the desire, the hunger! Never again will you fear a camera lens!
Luka|After that, we went to BladeWorks and you bought me Samidare. I didn’t expect that.
Rintaro|Ah, well...
Luka|I was really surprised when you said it didn’t matter... but at the same time... it really made me happy.
Luka|It’s strange, huh. Those words really moved me.
Luka|Ever since you said those words...
Luka|I’ve liked you.
Rintaro|...
Luka|Today... was really fun.
Rintaro|R-really?
Luka|So... um...
Rintaro|Wh-what is it?
Luka|Well... tomorrow...
Rintaro|Ah... eh?
Luka|I want to be with Okabe-san again... tomorrow.
Rintaro|T-thanks...
Luka|Is that... okay?
Rintaro|Of course it is. Yes. Of course.
Luka|Thank goodness...
Luka|Well, see you tomorrow...
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Welcome backarin.
Itaru|Die, you filthy normal.
Itaru|Since when does a chuunibyou patient like you rate a girlfriend? It’s not right, man.
Mayuri|How’d your date with Luka-chan go?
Rintaro|Well... Stage Clear, somehow. Probably.
Mayuri|ComiMa’s the day after tomorrow, you know? What if you and Luka-chan go as a cosplay couple?
Mayuri|Maybe you can persuade her to go, now that you’re her boyfriend.
Mayuri|She never says yes to me. And I’ve asked her so many times, too.
Mayuri|But if Okarin asks her, then I’m sure she’ll say OK!
Rintaro|I refuse.
Mayuri|Eh? Why?
Rintaro|To be honest, I don’t get this dating thing.
Itaru|Geh!? Okarin, you idiot, those words are an insult to virgins the world over! Apologize! Apologize to the virgins!
Rintaro|Just think about it. All you do is walk, eat, and go home. And the whole time, you have to worry about what your partner is thinking.
Rintaro|What’s fun about that?
Mayuri|Don’t say that, Okarin. You’ll make Luka-chan sad.
Mayuri|You know... just being with the person she likes is enough to make a girl happy. That’s all she really needs.
Mayuri|Doesn’t being together make boys happy too?
Mayuri|If not... that makes Mayuri sad.
Itaru|Okarin’s the minority. I mean, dates are a great opportunity for H-scenes.
Rintaro|You’re an idiot.
Itaru|Come on! Holding hands and stuff’s pretty H, isn’t it? And when you’re arm-in-arm and her boob hits your elbow, that’s like super mega H!
Itaru|And then at the end of the date, you kiss, right!? Damn you! Death to normals!
Rintaro|You play too much eroge.
Mayuri|Hey, hey. When did Luka-chan fall for Okarin?
Rintaro|When? Well...
Luka|I was really surprised when you said it didn’t matter... but at the same time... it really made me happy.
Luka|Ever since you said those words...
Luka|I’ve liked you.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|...Right. That doesn’t make sense.
Faris|...I remember, nya!
Faris|The wish Faris made...
Faris|...Was to save Papa, who died ten years ago, nya.
Luka|Good morning.
Rintaro|M-morning.
Luka|Um... where are we going today?
Rintaro|Before that...
Luka|Yes?
Rintaro|Do you have any memories of when you were a guy?
Luka|...
Luka|N-no, I don’t...
Rintaro|Really?
Rintaro|...
Luka|...
Luka|...I’m sorry.
Luka|Let’s cancel... today’s date...
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Okarin! Luka-chan!
Mayuri|Welcome to ComiMa, Luka-chan.
Luka|Y-yeah. It’s my first time coming here, but it’s amazing...
Mayuri|Take it easy!
Rintaro|Where’s Daru?
Mayuri|Um, Daru-kun’s in line for promo goods. He couldn’t come.
Mayuri|He said maybe he’ll join us later, if he survives the battle.
Luka|...
Mayuri|Mayushii will show you around, okay? Um, there’s lots of people, so we’ve gotta be careful.
Mayuri|First we’ll go to the cosplay area! And then we’ll go inside!
Mayuri|Hey, is there anything you guys wanna see?
Rintaro|...Lukako, is there anything you want to see?
Luka|Ah, no...
Luka|It’s my first time, so... if Okabe-san wants to see something, I’ll go see it...
Rintaro|I’m not particularly interested in anything.
Luka|...
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Hey, Luka-chan. If you come to the cosplay area, I’m sure you’ll change your mind about cosplaying!
Mayuri|It’s not embarrassing at all, see? ’Cause everyone’s having fun!
Mayuri|Kaede-chan and Fubuki-chan are there wearing Mayushii’s costumes! I’ll introduce you, okay?
Mayuri|You should come tomorrow too! I’ll bring costumes for you and we can cosplay together!
Mayuri|I think Okarin would be perfect as Zerosum from Code Jeass.
Mayuri|You’ll cosplay if Okarin does it with you, right, Luka-chan?
Mayuri|You will, won’t you? Mayushii thinks it’s a great idea!
Rintaro|Not a chance.
Luka|S-sorry...
Mayuri|Eh? No way...
Rintaro|...
Luka|...
Rintaro|...
Luka|...
Luka|Uuh... hic...
Rintaro|Lukako...
Luka|Uugh... ugg... sniff...
Luka|Thank you... very much...
Rintaro|Eh...?
Luka|I was... really happy... sniff...
Luka|That we could be... together...
Luka|I’m glad... I fell in love... with you...
Luka|...Bye now.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|...
Luka|Um...?
Rintaro|Come on!
Luka|O-Okabe-san? Um, the bus is here...
Rintaro|We’re not going to ComiMa.
Luka|Eh...?
Rintaro|This time... we’re doing things my way!
Luka|Okabe-san... um, where are we going?
Rintaro|...
Luka|Okabe...san?
Luka|...
Luka|This means... our relationship is over, doesn’t it...
Rintaro|Heh! What are you talking about?
Luka|Eh...?
Rintaro|Our couple phase isn’t over yet!
Luka|B-but...
Rintaro|Weren’t you listening? This time, we’re doing things my way.
Rintaro|Now, my disciple!
Rintaro|Bring forth the demon sword, Samidare!
Luka|Wh... what?
Rintaro|Isn’t it obvious? It’s time to continue your training in the Seishin Zanma school of swordsmanship!
Luka|My training...
Rintaro|Have you already forgotten what I taught you?
Luka|N-no... but, Oka--
Rintaro|It’s Kyouma.
Luka|...Eh?
Rintaro|Have you forgotten my true name, Lukako?
Rintaro|I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!
Rintaro|I was so caught up in the question of your gender that I lost sight of our true relationship.
Luka|...
Rintaro|But now I’ve finally realized the truth. Our relationship was decided from the very beginning.
Luka|Decided... how?
Rintaro|I may be a man and you may be a woman, but our temporary relationship as a couple...
Rintaro|Matters not!
Luka|Ah...
Rintaro|I am I. Lukako is Lukako.
Rintaro|And Lukako is my disciple.
Luka|Y-yes... of course. Okabe... I mean, Kyouma-san... is my master.
Rintaro|Well said! Now, Lukako, bring forth Samidare.
Luka|A-at once!
Luka|Um, just a moment. I’ll be right back. Please stay here, okay?
Rintaro|I’m not going anywhere. So hurry.
Rintaro|Alright, that’s it for today.
Luka|Thank you.
Luka|I think I got a little stronger.
Rintaro|No need for humility. Today, you mastered one of the Seishin Zanma style’s secrets, Type Thirty-Two Cherry Bomb.
Rintaro|But don’t get cocky, for you are still weak.
Luka|Yes sir. I want to learn even more from you.
Luka|I feel like it’s been a long time since you last taught me, Kyouma-san.
Rintaro|For the past few days, my mind has been under the dread influence of the foul grimoire known as The Manual.
Rintaro|But I’ve fully recovered. Do not worry.
Luka|...Thank goodness. You’re back to your old self.
Luka|Um...
Luka|Yesterday, you asked me if I had any memories from when I was a guy.
Rintaro|Oh, yeah...
Luka|I... do remember.
Rintaro|...
Luka|I remember, or actually... umm, how should I say it...
Luka|It’s a very... transient feeling.
Rintaro|Transient...
Luka|I can’t clearly remember it, but at the bottom of my sea of memories, well... in my head, umm...
Luka|It feels like it’s around here somewhere...
Rintaro|Anyway, you remember?
Luka|I’m sorry I lied yesterday...
Rintaro|Muhahaha! Don’t worry about it. You should be proud to have fooled the great Hououin Kyouma!
Luka|So because I remembered, I knew Mom’s pager number without having to ask.
Luka|I was going to give you this no matter how things turned out today.
Luka|And... one more thing.
Luka|I don’t know if it’s related to my memories, but...
Luka|It’s about that old computer.
Rintaro|...!?
Rintaro|The IBN 5100!?
Luka|Yes... I think so...
Rintaro|If that’s true, Lukako, then you might not have to turn back into a guy.
Luka|...
Luka|I don’t think it’s that easy...
Rintaro|But why not?
Luka|Please come with me. I’ll show you.
Rintaro|The IBN 5100 is here?
Luka|Um... not there...
Luka|It happened last year, just before New Years...
Luka|The computer was at our shrine until then.
Luka|It’s all my fault. I was helping out at the shrine, sweeping the storehouse when...
Luka|I broke it by accident.
Rintaro|You... broke it?
Luka|But I thought Dad would get mad at me if he found out, so...
Luka|I brought it here... and hid it in the coin locker.
Rintaro|It must have been tough bringing it all the way out here. That thing weighs a ton.
Luka|I used a pushcart from home. It... broke too.
Luka|When I heard Kyouma-san was searching for it, I was really surprised.
Luka|I know I should’ve told you the truth, but I thought you’d hate me for it, and I couldn’t say anything.
Rintaro|Nonsense. I wouldn’t hate you for that. No matter what, you’re still my disciple.
Luka|I know.
Luka|It’s already been more than half a year, so the management probably took it away...
Rintaro|Half a year... I guess it’s hopeless, then.
Luka|Ah... it’s not locked...
Rintaro|I guess that settles it.
Luka|...I’m sorry.
Rintaro|It’s not your fault.
Rintaro|I’m the one who messed with the timeline. Everything that happened is my fault.
Luka|Kyouma-san...
Luka|Um... there’s something strange about my memories.
Rintaro|Strange how?
Luka|Inside my mind, there are two memories about that old computer mixed together...
Luka|The first is the memory of me breaking it. The other has no memory of it at all...
Luka|The male me didn’t break the computer. He swept the main shrine instead of the storehouse...
Luka|So there’s no choice... I have to go back to being a guy.
Luka|So this is goodbye...
Rintaro|Yeah.
Luka|I’m really happy... that I could train with you again.
Rintaro|I didn’t really do anything... boyfriend-like for you, did I?
Luka|That doesn’t matter.
Rintaro|Yeah, you’re right.
Luka|...Please, save Mayuri-chan.
Luka|Mayuri-chan is... really important to me.
Rintaro|Lukako...
Luka|Ahaha... um, please, go already. If you don’t... I might cry...
Luka|So, please...
Luka|Thank you... for everything.
Luka|Ah, this is when I use that phrase, right?
Luka|Umm, El Psy Kongalee...
Rintaro|It’s Kongroo.
Luka|El Psy Kongroo.
Kurisu|Okabe? Mayuri called. She was mad. You stood her up on your promise to go to ComiMa.
Rintaro|Christina. I need you to enter a number into the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Kurisu|What? Explain yourself.
Rintaro|Please, just do it... I’m sending a D-Mail.
Rintaro|The number is...
Luka|...
Luka|I really... don’t want to change back...
Luka|Because... because...
Luka|If I change back into a guy... I’ll have to hide my feelings for you!
Luka|It would be wrong for me to love you, if I’m a guy...
Luka|My memories of today will vanish too... won’t they?
Luka|That we held hands and walked together...
Luka|That we trained together after such a long time...
Luka|That I’m touching Okabe-san’s body right now...
Luka|I don’t want to forget... I don’t!
Luka|Because I love you... I love you, Okabe-san!
Luka|I want to save Mayuri-chan too, and I understand there’s no other way, but...
Luka|It still hurts...
Luka|At the very least, I want to keep my memories of today.
Luka|If I’d known it would hurt this much...
Luka|Then I never would’ve wished to become a girl in the first place.
Rintaro|Lukako...
Luka|Sniff...
Luka|I’m sorry. I know ’that doesn’t matter’ to you, right? Sniff...
Rintaro|Even as a guy, you’re still Lukako to me. That won’t change.
Luka|Yes... It makes me happy to hear you say that...
Luka|Okabe-san... please send the email.
Rintaro|...
Luka|Please. Send it quickly...
Luka|If you let me feel your warmth any longer, I...
Luka|I might say even worse things...
Luka|I can’t hold back my feelings anymore!
Rintaro|Lukako...
Luka|Okabe-san... please!
Luka|Will you... remember me?
Rintaro|...Yes.
Luka|Will you remember me... as a girl?
Rintaro|...Yes.
Luka|Will you remember these four short days we were together?
Rintaro|...Yes.
Luka|Thank you... Okabe-san.
Luka|Farewell... my love...
Rintaro|No. I can’t do it!
Luka|Okabe-san... Why?
Rintaro|I can’t do it anymore... I can’t sacrifice anybody else’s memories! 
Rintaro|I don’t have the right!
Luka|Okabe-san...
Rintaro|Lukako...
Mayuri|Sorry, Okarin. Did I wake you up?
Rintaro|No, I wasn’t really asleep.
Rintaro|You’re pretty early, Mayuri.
Mayuri|Actually, Mayushii’s here to pick up her costumes.
Mayuri|And breakfast!
Rintaro|Are you going to ComiMa now?
Mayuri|Yeah♪ Daru-kun already left on the first bus.
Rintaro|Oh...
Mayuri|Hey, Okarin. Where’d you go with Luka-chan yesterday?
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Did you have a fun date? You know, Luka-chan hasn’t replied to my mails since yesterday.
Rintaro|You emailed Lukako?
Mayuri|Yeah. Mayushii’s a little worried, you know.
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Did you make Luka-chan cry again? That would make Mayushii sad...
Rintaro|...Sad?
Mayuri|Sad. Luka-chan is Mayushii’s friend.
Rintaro|Are you going to be at ComiMa all day?
Mayuri|Eh? Yeah, why?
Rintaro|Is it okay if I bring Lukako?
Mayuri|Really? Of course it’s okay!
Rintaro|You tried asking Lukako to cosplay, right? How’d it go?
Mayuri|Well... I couldn’t convince her
Mayuri|I don’t want to force her, you know. That would make her hate cosplay!
Mayuri|But you know, it might be a good idea to bring Luka-chan to ComiMa.
Mayuri|You think maybe if she saw other cosplayers having fun, Luka-chan might want to try it too?
Mayuri|Do you think we could get her to cosplay at the next ComiMa?
Rintaro|I wonder.
Mayuri|That would be nice.
Mayuri|Hey, will you really bring Luka-chan over today?
Rintaro|Yeah.
Mayuri|Will you come too, and look at the costumes Mayushii made?
Rintaro|Yes, I will.
Mayuri|Yay♪ That would make me really happy!
Mayuri|Welp, gotta get going.
Mayuri|Be sure to come, okay? I’ll be waiting. I’ll show you all the best stuff so you’ll want to come tomorrow too!
Mayuri|Okarin? Something wrong?
Rintaro|Nothing’s wrong. Just thinking up ways to defeat the Organization.
Rintaro|Let’s meet in Ariake in the afternoon.
Mayuri|Okay. I’ll be waiting.
Mayuri|Mayushii’s always here for you to talk to when you need her, okay?
Rintaro|Mayuri...
Mayuri|Ehehe! I’m off!
Mayuri|Okarin?
Mayuri|You came! But you’re late.
Mayuri|Mayushii was waiting...
Mayuri|I was really lonely...
Rintaro|Sorry.
Mayuri|Where’s Luka-chan?
Rintaro|She’s not coming.
Mayuri|Did you make her cry again?
Rintaro|No...
Mayuri|Okarin?
Rintaro|H-heheheh, muuhahaha! Fret not, Mayuri! Things between me and Lukako are absolutely marvelous!
Rintaro|That miko and I are tied by a strong bond. That’s right, Lukako and I are connected by fate, whether we like it or not!
Rintaro|And today I, the genius with an IQ of 170, have returned the smile to Lukako’s face.
Rintaro|She even said so herself. That it was fun to be with me in our pursuit of knowledge!
Mayuri|Really? That’s great!
Mayuri|So there’s no reason for Okarin and Luka-chan to break up, right?
Rintaro|Uh, right. We won’t break up.
Mayuri|Great! Then Mayushii can concentrate on ComiMa without any worries!
Rintaro|Are you going to participate tomorrow too?
Mayuri|Yup! It lasts three whole days.
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Daru-kun’s late...
Mayuri|I called him just now, and he said he was still close by.
Rintaro|We don’t really have to wait for him.
Mayuri|Let’s wait a little bit longer.
Mayuri|Hey, do you think we can convince Luka-chan to cosplay somehow?
Mayuri|How should we persuade her, though?
Mayuri|I think Luka-chan would be an absolutely perfect Kirari-chan cosplayer.
Mayuri|Luka-chan’s so cute, she makes Mayushii’s heart throb, you know.
Mayuri|I want to spread Luka-chan’s cuteness to people all over the world. Don’t you, Okarin?
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Ah, or maybe you plan to keep Luka-chan all to yourself? But you know, you shouldn’t monopolize her. Even Mayushii wants to kyun-kyun with Luka-chan!
Rintaro|I don’t mind. It’s not like I can keep her all to myself.
Mayuri|Ehehe! Yay♪
Mayuri|Anyway, there’s one more reason I want to get Luka-chan to cosplay.
Mayuri|Luka-chan’s usually a quiet girl, right? She almost never says what she thinks.
Mayuri|When you cosplay, you become someone other than yourself.
Mayuri|That’s why I think that if Luka-chan cosplays once, she’ll definitely find a new Luka-chan, even if it’s embarrassing at first.
Mayuri|And when that happens, she’ll become more assertive than before, and maybe even dominate you, Okarin! Ehehe!
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|...
Rintaro|Can you see the stars?
Mayuri|Yeah.
Rintaro|Hey, Mayuri--
Itaru|Okarin! Mayu-shi!
Mayuri|Daru-kun! You’re late!
Itaru|Haa, whew, my bad. Man, it took forever to check my spoils.
Mayuri|Ok, let’s go!
Itaru|It was so hot today, I thought I was gonna die! How was the cosplay?
Mayuri|The breeze felt great!
Itaru|Maybe you should cosplay next time.
Itaru|And when did you get here, Okarin? Buy anything?
Rintaro|No.
Itaru|Huh? Why so grim? You have a girlfriend like one of those filthy normals now. You’ve got no right to be depressed.
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Okarin? Is something wro--
Mayuri|Ah, guh, uh...
Itaru|Mayu-shi...?
Itaru|Mayu-shi! What’s wrong!?
Itaru|She’s not breathing...
Itaru|What is this... what the hell is this?
Itaru|Okarin! There’s something wrong with Mayu-shi!
Rintaro|...She’s dead.
Itaru|Dead...? No way! We were just talking!
Itaru|Hey, Mayu-shi! Wake up! Where’s the camera!? We’re on candid camera, right!?
Rintaro|Daru.
Rintaro|Mayuri’s dead.
Rintaro|Let’s call an ambulance.
Itaru|Why did this happen...
Itaru|How can you be so calm!?
Itaru|She’s dead! She’s never coming back! Don’t you get it, Okarin!?
Rintaro|...I get it.
Itaru|No, you don’t! She’s not breathing! See!?
Rintaro|I stood by... and let her die.
Itaru|What...?
Rintaro|I couldn’t save you, Mayuri.
Rintaro|No... I chose not to save you.
Rintaro|I abandoned you, Mayuri.
Kurisu|Okabe. It’s been three days. Will you at least eat something?
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|You knew, didn’t you?
Kurisu|You knew that Mayuri would die.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|Why don’t you time leap?
Kurisu|I was sure that you would do anything to save Mayuri, even use the Time Leap Machine.
Kurisu|What happened to your plan to change Urushibara-san’s gender and take back the IBN 5100?
Kurisu|You were so set on saving Mayuri. What are you still doing here?
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|Wait... did you already send the D-Mail? Did you already change worldlines?
Kurisu|If so, and you’re just a remnant Okabe left behind, then that means worldlines are parallel, and this line is doomed to continue without Mayuri...
Rintaro|...I didn’t send the D-Mail.
Kurisu|What do you mean?
Rintaro|...I couldn’t change Lukako back into a guy.
Rintaro|Instead... I chose to accept fate.
Rintaro|I stood by... and let Mayuri die.
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|...Will you eat?
Kurisu|I can make cup noodles, if you like. Or should I go get something?
Rintaro|Say something. I killed Mayuri. Why won’t you blame me?
Kurisu|I suppose I could, but why? It looks like you’ve already blamed yourself enough.
Kurisu|Maybe we just don’t have the right to change the past after all.
Kurisu|Besides...
Kurisu|No one can blame you.
Kurisu|You’ve been fighting alone this whole time, one man disconnected from causality.
Kurisu|No one else can understand your pain.
Kurisu|No one else can understand the meaning of your choice.
Kurisu|There’s no way I can blame you, when I haven’t time leaped even once.
Rintaro|...How can you be so understanding?
Kurisu|I’m not. When you chose to save Mayuri with the Time Leap Machine, you must have known that no one would ever understand.
Kurisu|So accept what you’ve done.
Kurisu|Do that, and you’ll never forget the meaning of your choice.
Kurisu|However...
Kurisu|You should also take responsibility for the girl you did save.
Kurisu|Mayuri is dead. It’s sad -- no, sad doesn’t even begin to describe it -- but Mayuri is gone.
Kurisu|You couldn’t change convergence. You couldn’t defy fate.
Kurisu|But she is still alive. Thanks to you, she’s still alive, as a girl.
Kurisu|And I think she’s suffering alone, just like you.
Kurisu|Aren’t you the only one who can understand her suffering? You’re her accomplice, remember?
Rintaro|Her accomplice...
Rintaro|Thank you, Kurisu.
Rintaro|I’m glad I told you.
Luka|Sniff...
Rintaro|Lukako...
Luka|Okabe... san.
Luka|Yesterday... I went to Mayuri-chan’s funeral...
Luka|Everyone cried. I didn’t know Mayuri-chan was loved by so many people...
Luka|Of course, I loved Mayuri-chan too...
Luka|I’m not really good with people, but she was always so nice to me...
Luka|She was my best friend...
Luka|Why, Okabe-san...
Luka|Why are we still alive?
Rintaro|...
Luka|Mayuri-chan is dead...
Luka|But I’m... still a girl...
Luka|It just feels wrong for me to keep living like this...
Rintaro|It’s not wrong.
Luka|Is there a way to save Mayuri-chan?
Rintaro|...No.
Luka|That can’t be!
Luka|Let’s keep thinking! I’ll do anything to save Mayuri-chan!
Luka|I heard from Mayuri-chan before... that you made a device for traveling back in time.
Luka|If we use that...
Rintaro|We can’t.
Luka|If we go back in time, I’m sure we’ll find a way...
Rintaro|There is no way.
Rintaro|It may be cruel, but all we can do is accept Mayuri’s death and keep on living.
Luka|You can’t give up! Why are you giving up? Aren’t you sad at all that Mayuri-chan died?
Rintaro|...There’s no way to save her.
Luka|No! I don’t want Mayuri-chan to die!
Rintaro|Lukako!
Rintaro|Did you think it was easy for me to give up?
Luka|Okabe-san...
Rintaro|She was my precious childhood friend. I would have done anything to save her.
Rintaro|I tried to find a way. I tried everything I could think of! Do you know how many times I’ve gone back!?
Rintaro|But nothing worked. The universe wants her dead. No matter how I try to avoid it, fate snatches Mayuri away.
Rintaro|I sacrificed other people’s memories and dreams. All to save Mayuri. I didn’t care who I hurt, as long as I could save her.
Rintaro|But I can’t do it anymore...
Rintaro|There’s nothing I can do...
Luka|...I’m sorry.
Luka|I didn’t stop to think about your feelings.
Rintaro|...
Luka|But it’s not impossible... is it? There’s still one more way left...
Luka|If you turn me back into a guy...
Rintaro|I can’t do that.
Luka|Please, Okabe-san. I don’t want to be a girl so badly that I’d sacrifice Mayuri-chan!
Luka|Please, save Mayuri-chan!
Rintaro|I won’t turn you back into a guy.
Luka|Why...
Luka|Why won’t you!?
Rintaro|That’s what I chose. I can’t keep on hurting people to feed my ego.
Rintaro|Besides, even if we go back to the original worldline, there’s no guarantee we’ll avoid Mayuri’s death.
Rintaro|I won’t sacrifice anyone’s memories... I won’t sacrifice your memories... for a small chance like that.
Rintaro|It’s over.
Luka|But, Okabe-san...
Luka|This is unforgivable...
Luka|I don’t deserve to live like this...
Luka|How can I go on... knowing that me being a girl contributed to Mayuri’s death?
Luka|That’s too heavy a burden... for me to bear...
Luka|Why...
Luka|Why didn’t you send the mail to my mom’s pager 18 years ago?
Luka|Why didn’t you choose Mayuri-chan over me?
Rintaro|You have nothing to be ashamed of. It was my choice.
Rintaro|I killed Mayuri. The guilt is mine.
Rintaro|Besides, I want you to be happy.
Luka|...
Luka|Happy? How can I possibly be happy...
Luka|When Mayuri died because of me?
Rintaro|It wasn’t because of you. Please, never say that again. You may be sad now, but...
Rintaro|I want you to keep going forward, and live enough for Mayuri, too.
Luka|No... I don’t want that!
Luka|In that case... I want to help bear your burden, together...
Rintaro|Bear it together? Don’t be ridiculous.
Rintaro|I’m a man disconnected from causality. I chose to stand by and let Mayuri die.
Luka|Then I’ll disconnect myself from causality too...
Luka|I regained my memories of being a guy, so doesn’t that mean I’m already disconnected?
Luka|I also know that I’m only a girl because Mayuri paid for it with her life...
Luka|We’re... accomplices.
Luka|This sadness. This guilt.
Luka|I want us both to embrace them, so we don’t forget...
Rintaro|I understand.
Rintaro|Let’s bear our burden together.
Rintaro|Let’s live with these memories... together.
Luka|Can I stay by your side forever?
Luka|I love you...
Luka|I know I’m betraying Mayuri-chan... but I want to be with you forever.
Rintaro|Of course.
Luka|Hey, Okabe-san...
Luka|There’s one thing that I should have done for Mayuri-chan, but didn’t.
Luka|And because I didn’t, I made her sad.
Rintaro|What was it?
Luka|...Cosplay.
Mayuri|I think Luka-chan would be an absolutely perfect Kirari-chan cosplayer!
Mayuri|Luka-chan’s so cute, she makes Mayushii’s heart throb, you know.
Mayuri|Luka-chan’s usually a very obedient girl, you know? She rarely speaks her mind.
Mayuri|When you cosplay, you become another you.
Mayuri|That’s why I think that if Luka-chan cosplays once, she’ll definitely find a new Luka-chan, even if it’s embarrassing at first.
Mayuri|And when that happens, she’ll become more assertive than before, and maybe even dominate you, Okarin! Ehehe!
Luka|Can your time machine take me back to that day?
Rintaro|You mean you want to go back!?
Rintaro|Are you serious?
Rintaro|It’s too dangerous. So far, I’m the only one who’s used it.
Luka|Please!
Luka|At the very least, I want to see Mayuri-chan off with a smile.
Luka|Because I wasn’t able to do anything for her...
Rintaro|But I thought you couldn’t handle all the otaku.
Luka|I am a bit scared... but this is something I have to do.
Luka|Besides, I want to truly be the same as you, Okabe-san.
Luka|If I use that device... I’ll be completely disconnected from causality, won’t I?
Luka|And then, I could feel what you feel...
Luka|So please...
Rintaro|What time will you jump to?
Luka|The morning of that day.
Luka|If I jump to the day before, I don’t think I’ll be mentally stable enough to accept it as reality.
Luka|That’s why...
Rintaro|Once you’ve leaped safely, get in touch with me. I’m sure I’ll help you get to Mayuri.
Luka|Okay...
Rintaro|Don’t worry. Your brain will hurt a bit, but the pain will go away soon.
Luka|O-okay...
Rintaro|You must not get distracted once you reach the other side. Calm down and try to grasp your surroundings.
Rintaro|It’ll be okay. I’m with you.
Luka|...I’m going.
Luka|I’ll be sure to come back!
Rintaro|Yeah. I’ll be waiting.
Luka|Okabe-sa--
Rintaro|What the...
Luka|Want to see the pictures?
Rintaro|Pictures?
Luka|It worked. I did it.
Luka|Don’t you remember? You suddenly started acting different just now.
Rintaro|Right after you leaped into the past, I found myself standing here.
Rintaro|Did you go to ComiMa?
Luka|Mayuri-chan... was so happy...
Rintaro|It looks like we really got carried away...
Luka|...?
Rintaro|Hey, Lukako.
Luka|Yes?
Rintaro|You’re...
Rintaro|You’re a guy, right?
Luka|Um... yes?
Rintaro|Do you... like me?
Luka|W-what? I... don’t understand.
Rintaro|...Do you like me?
Luka|Um...
Luka|I respect you!
Luka|If I change back into a guy... I’ll have to hide my feelings for you!
Rintaro|Thanks. You are my disciple, now and forever. Agreed?
Luka|Y-yes! Of course I am.
Rintaro|Lukako, do you remember breaking an old computer in the shrine storehouse last year?
Luka|An old computer? No, I don’t remember anything like that.
Luka|I don’t really understand computers. I haven’t played with them much.
Rintaro|Go get your father for me.
Luka’s Father|An old computer... yes, I do remember.
Luka’s Father|I’ll go check. Please wait a moment.
Luka’s Father|It’s gone. I couldn’t find it anywhere.
Luka’s Father|The lock to the storehouse was broken. Someone may have stolen it.
Rintaro|Stolen it?
Luka’s Father|There’s evidence someone dragged something heavy away. That wasn’t there at the end-of-the-year cleaning, and the lock wasn’t broken when I checked last month.
Luka’s Father|I never expected a thief would break in.
Luka|Then shouldn’t we report it to the police?
Rintaro|This isn’t going to work.
Luka|Um, Okabe-san. I don’t really understand, but please don’t be sad.
Luka|J-just go ’It matters not!’ like you always do.
Rintaro|You’re using that phrase wrong, you know.
Mayuri|Phew. I’m stuffed! I barely ate today, so I was hungry!
Kurisu|Is there more tomorrow?
Mayuri|Yeah, and the day after, too.
Mayuri|Okeydokey! Mayushii’s got an early day tomorrow, so I’m going home.
Mayuri|Hey guys, why don’t you come too?
Rintaro|I’ll pass, but my assistant looks like she wants to go.
Kurisu|What!?
Kurisu|Hey! Don’t put words in my mouth!
Rintaro|I saw your eyes sparkling while you listened to Mayuri’s cosplay stories.
Kurisu|Maybe, but nobody said anything about going.
Mayuri|Come on, Chris-chan!
Kurisu|No way. I’d suffocate in a crowd like that.
Mayuri|It’s not as crowded on day two! If you’re worried, come in the afternoon. All the popular stuff will be sold out, though.
Kurisu|You go, Okabe. You’re Mayuri’s guardian, aren’t you?
Mayuri|No, Mayushii is Okarin’s hostage!
Kurisu|Oh, right. That’s what it was.
Kurisu|Well you don’t want your hostage to escape, do you? Shouldn’t you take her along in handcuffs or something?
Rintaro|I’ve got business in Akiba.
Kurisu|What do you mean, business?
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|No answer? I guess it was just an excuse.
Rintaro|Christina. We need to talk.
Kurisu|Again? Abrupt as usual.
Rintaro|Hm? What do you mean, again?
Kurisu|Nothing.
Mayuri|Whatcha gonna talk about?
Mayuri|You two have been really close lately, huh? You’re always talking together.
Mayuri|Mayushii really wants to join in your secret meetings and stuff.
Rintaro|Don’t worry. We’ve been talking about the Time Leap Machine. It would just be gibberish to you.
Rintaro|Besides, the purpose of this particular discussion is to convince Christina to attend ComiMa. Prepare for good news, Mayuri! Muhahaha!
Mayuri|Oh, great! Thanks, Okarin.
Rintaro|So, Christina.
Kurisu|I’m not going to ComiMa.
Rintaro|You said ’again’ just now. We’ve talked like this before, just the two of us?
Kurisu|Losing your memory now? Does our little mad scientist have an acetylcholine deficiency?
Rintaro|I’m being serious.
Kurisu|You’re acting weird today. What’s going on?
Rintaro|Please. I need to know.
Kurisu|I mean, yeah. This is like the fifth time you’ve brought me outside to talk about the Time Leap Machine.
Rintaro|Have we talked about my time leaping?
Kurisu|You’re time leaping?
Rintaro|More than a dozen times already.
Kurisu|That many!? What the hell are you doing!?
Kurisu|...I think I get it.
Kurisu|Don’t wear yourself out.
Rintaro|It’s a disgrace to be comforted by my assistant.
Kurisu|Why are you always like that!? I’m even trying to be nice. You’re really full of yourself, you know?
Rintaro|I don’t need your sympathy. Everything that happened is my fault. I’m just getting what I deserve.
Rintaro|...Come to think of it, every time I explain this to you, I always end up hating myself in the end.
Kurisu|Okabe...
Rintaro|Don’t worry about me. Worry about Mayuri.
Rintaro|Mayuri will probably die tomorrow. I don’t know how it will happen.
Rintaro|Sorry about this, but I want you to be there when she dies tomorrow night.
Kurisu|That’s why you want me to go to ComiMa?
Rintaro|There’s nothing we can do to prevent her death. Just stay close and tell me when it happens.
Rintaro|Once I know, I’ll make the time leap.
Kurisu|I can’t believe there’s nothing we can do.
Kurisu|It just doesn’t feel real. But it’s the truth, isn’t it? I can see it in your eyes.
Kurisu|...Are you okay?
Rintaro|No. I still haven’t saved Mayu--
Kurisu|I know. That’s not what I meant.
Kurisu|Are you okay?
Rintaro|I don’t follow.
Kurisu|You’re carrying an awful burden.
Rintaro|I told you not to worry about me. It’s Mayuri you need to worry about.
Rintaro|Tomorrow, I’m going to look for Moeka.
Rintaro|I wish there were some way that Mayuri wouldn’t have to suffer...
Kurisu|Then why don’t you time leap now?
Rintaro|I can’t plan effectively without knowing the deadline.
Kurisu|I don’t want to see Mayuri die either, you know.
Rintaro|I know how you feel, but you’re the only one I can ask.
Kurisu|Where did all this trust come from?
Rintaro|...You’re my assistant, after all.
Kurisu|You’re so full of yourself.
Male Staff-Member|We don’t have an employee by that name.
Rintaro|You... don’t?
Male Staff-Member|Wait a second. There was a girl who worked here just two days before disappearing. I think her name might’ve been Kiryu.
Male Staff-Member|We might still have her resume.
Rintaro|Excuse me. Did the person who lives there move?
Officer|Huh? No.
Rintaro|Then...?
Officer|Are you related?
Rintaro|...I knew her.
Officer|You haven’t heard?
Rintaro|What happened?
Officer|Suicide.
Rintaro|What...?
Rintaro|When!?
Officer|Yesterday.
Rintaro|No way...
Officer|They took her to Chiyoda Third Central Hospital. Doesn’t look like she had any relatives. We don’t know who to notify. Will you go see the body?
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Time leap...
Rintaro|Electrical discharge!?
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|In other words... I have nothing.
Rintaro|...!
Rintaro|Hello!?
Kurisu|Okabe! She’s... aah... why... I don’t...
Kurisu|She just... I saw it happen! She’s dead! Mayuri’s dead! This... this can’t be...
Kurisu|She s-suddenly collapsed. Why!? It doesn’t make sense. She’s not breathing. She won’t answer at all. Please, Mayuri!
Kurisu|Okabe, what should I... what do I do? Help! Please! Mayuri’s dead!
Rintaro|...I’m sorry for making you go through this.
Rintaro|I’m heading out.
Rintaro|...Kiryu Moeka.
Rintaro|Can you hear me?
Moeka|...Who?
Moeka|...FB? Is it you?
Rintaro|FB?
Moeka|Why won’t you contact me? I did everything you told me to.
Moeka|Did I do something wrong? I’ll fix it, I promise. Just don’t abandon me. I’ll do anything for you, FB.
Moeka|Please, answer me. Give me orders. I’ll obey. Tell me what to do... tell me... tell me...
Moeka|uugh... uugh...
Rintaro|Hey, can you hear me? Hey!
Moeka|FB... why... why won’t you answer...
Rintaro|Kiryu Moeka! Hey! It’s me! Okabe!
Rintaro|What the...
Moeka|No!
Moeka|...
Moeka|...No mails.
Moeka|No mails...
Rintaro|...You mean from FB?
Moeka|...No mails.
Moeka|...uugh...
Moeka|Why won’t you respond, FB? You’re the one who recruited me...
Rintaro|...Dammit.
Rintaro|Hello?
Kurisu|Finally.
Kurisu|Where are you?
Rintaro|Hello.
Kurisu|Where are you?
Rintaro|...Sorry, I’m busy.
Kurisu|Is it woman? You’re with a woman, aren’t you?
Rintaro|Is that the first thing that comes to mind? You really are a mainstream girl.
Kurisu|Shut up.
Kurisu|You promised you’d help with the PhoneWave, remember? Or is your lab mem number just for show?
Rintaro|Get Daru to help. I can’t do it today.
Kurisu|...What are you doing? Where are you?
Rintaro|Kiryu Moeka’s apartment.
Kurisu|So you are with a woman. You’re the worst.
Kurisu|You have to take it from her by force.
Rintaro|You’ve seen too many Hollywood movies.
Kurisu|You’re up against an agent of SERN. Play nice and you could end up dead.
Kurisu|Don’t hesitate. Remember you’re doing this to save Mayuri.
Kurisu|I know you’re pretty weak and scrawny, but you should be able to handle her in her current state.
Kurisu|You might think I’m a monster for saying this... not that I care what you think, but...
Kurisu|Kill her if you have to.
Rintaro|You’re a monster.
Rintaro|But you’re not a hypocrite, and that’s what I love about you, Christina.
Kurisu|L-love!? Uh...
Rintaro|I mean it. I wish my conviction were as strong as yours.
Kurisu|...Well, thanks.
Rintaro|But that’s not all, right? There’s a reason you’re willing to suggest murder as an option. How did you reach that conclusion?
Kurisu|Good, you’re still thinking.
Kurisu|I can’t be certain whether your story is true, and I don’t quite understand this attractor field hypothesis.
Kurisu|But based on what you told me...
Kurisu|If this Kiryu woman commits suicide four days from now, then that means her death flag is already active.
Kurisu|In other words, this worldline has approved her death.
Kurisu|On previous worldlines where that wasn’t the case, you probably couldn’t have killed her even if you tried. Something would have happened to prevent it.
Kurisu|Or possibly, killing her would have caused a dramatic shift in worldline divergence.
Kurisu|But on this specific worldline, her death is already certain.
Kurisu|As you’ve experienced with Mayuri’s death, the result is what matters, not the process.
Kurisu|I believe the same applies to Kiryu. It doesn’t matter how she dies.
Rintaro|She’s already going to die, so that makes it okay. That the kind of argument a murderer would make.
Kurisu|Don’t be a hypocrite. We’re not talking about right and wrong here, Okabe.
Rintaro|But what about the law? Even if fate forgives me, society won’t.
Kurisu|As long as you have the Time Leap Machine, you can undo anything, even murder.
Kurisu|The result will be that you gained the necessary information without killing anybody.
Rintaro|I understand.
Kurisu|...Phew. Just remember one thing. You’re responsible for what you do.
Kurisu|...I guess that’s quite a thing for me to say, huh? After telling you to kill her.
Rintaro|It’s fine. Your advice was truly becoming of a mad scientist.
Kurisu|Get it done, Okabe. Bye.
Rintaro|Who does she think she is, a general?
Moeka|N-no...!
Rintaro|Goh...!
Moeka|Gah...hah...
Rintaro|Now I have your attention!
Moeka|Hhh, hhhh, gh, haah, hhhh...
Rintaro|Give me your phone!
Rintaro|If you don’t, I’ll kill you!
Rintaro|Hand it over or I’ll kill you!
Moeka|Haah, khah, haah, kpph, haah...
Moeka|Guh, hgg, gah, hah, geh...!
Moeka|Guh!
Moeka|Ah... gah...!
Moeka|Gehh, gehhehuggehgehoh--
Moeka|Gehohgehohgehoh, khah, ga... beh.. gh...
Moeka|Gehohgehoh, bi...na...
Kurisu|This is Makise.
Rintaro|Get ready for a D-Mail!
Kurisu|Okay, but what’s that noise!?
Rintaro|I’m having a little trouble here.
Kurisu|So you didn’t kill her. Good job!
Kurisu|It’s ready.
Rintaro|And Mayuri?
Kurisu|Still here. She’s at the Braun Tube Workshop trying to get the manager to turn on the CRT.
Rintaro|You didn’t tell her anything, did you?
Kurisu|About her death? Of course not.
Rintaro|Good. Don’t hang up yet.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|...?
Rintaro|What? Why?
Rintaro|Well!?
Kurisu|Did you send it?
Rintaro|Yes. Did it work!?
Kurisu|The discharge is occurring as normal.
Rintaro|So it worked, right?
Kurisu|Definitely.
Rintaro|The worldline didn’t change!
Kurisu|You mean it failed? Why?
Rintaro|Maybe the message wasn’t enough to persuade Moeka to change models.
Kurisu|Could we have sent it to the wrong date?
Rintaro|It’s July 31st. I’m sure of it.
Kurisu|Check when the original D-Mail arrived. Maybe her reaction will change if the new one arrives just after that.
Rintaro|What a pain!
Kurisu|Try sending different messages.
Kurisu|If that doesn’t work, I’ll adjust the timer.
Rintaro|You’re a lifesaver. What’s going on there? Is Mister Braun freaking out?
Kurisu|I can hear him shouting from below. Hashida and Mayuri are trying to calm him down, but who knows how long that’ll last.
Kurisu|I don’t think there’s much time left.
Rintaro|Are you there?
Kurisu|Still not working?
Rintaro|I tried two more times, but nothing.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|Okabe? What’s wrong?
Rintaro|Nothing... changed?
Kurisu|Huh? What hasn’t changed?
Rintaro|No way...
Rintaro|That sneaky little...!
Rintaro|She’s crazy!
Kurisu|Okabe! Okabe!? Answer me!
Rintaro|...Christina.
Kurisu|What’s that pounding? Are you okay?
Rintaro|Moeka’s D-Mail wasn’t about a model exchange.
Kurisu|What do you mean!?
Rintaro|She must have changed the text right before we sent it. That’s why the cancellation mails aren’t working.
Kurisu|Did you check her history? It might still be there.
Rintaro|Her arrival history...
Rintaro|I should have thought of that. Checking now!
Rintaro|...Christina, I seem to be in a spot of trouble. If I fail, I’m leaving the rest to you.
Kurisu|Don’t be ridiculous! If you’re in trouble, then get out of--
Moeka|Okabeeeee!
Moeka|Give it back!
Moeka|Augh!
Moeka|Give it baaack!
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Guh!
Moeka|Haah, khaah, haah...
Moeka|Ah... agg... ggeh...!
Rintaro|Why you!
Moeka|Guh!
Rintaro|Haah, khah, haah...
Moeka|Uh... khuh... huuh... gh... uh...
Rintaro|That hurt, you crazy bitch!
Moeka|...ph!
Rintaro|Eye contact... good... we’re making progress...
Rintaro|I’m not giving it back.
Rintaro|I’m not letting you escape into your own little world again. You don’t have that right.
Moeka|Give it back!
Rintaro|Come and get it!
Rintaro|I can keep this up as long as I have to.
Rintaro|Who’s going to tire out first?
Moeka|Why did you take it!?
Moeka|Give it back! Give it baaack!
Rintaro|Keep screaming.
Rintaro|I don’t care about your phone issues. I don’t care about FB.
Rintaro|You don’t kill her on this worldline, and the worldlines where you did have already been erased.
Rintaro|But I remember! I remember everything you did! Everything that never happened!
Rintaro|I’ll never forget that you killed Mayuri! And I’ll never forgive you!
Rintaro|So there’s no escape for you today. We’re gonna stay here as long as it takes.
Rintaro|So let’s be honest with each other, huh?
Moeka|Give it back! Give it baack!
Moeka|Give it back! I’ll kill you! I’ll fucking kill you!
Moeka|Let... me... go!
Moeka|I’ll tear... your fucking... eyes out!
Rintaro|So you can talk without your phone. I’m impressed.
Moeka|You piece of shit! I’ll gut you with a kitchen knife!
Rintaro|I’m a mad scientist. Dissection is my specialty.
Moeka|Die! Die! Help! I’m being raped!
Nishida|Hello? This is Nishida from next door. Is everything okay?
Nishida|Do you need the police? If not, then could you please keep it down?
Nishida|The walls here are pretty thin.
Moeka|He’s going to kill me!
Moeka|No! Stop it! Don’t kill me!
Moeka|Call the pol--nnuh!?
Moeka|Mmm...gh...nn...
Nishida|Kids these days...
Rintaro|Pwah!
Rintaro|Don’t act like it’s your first time. You’re older than me, remember?
Moeka|Haah... haah... kh...
Moeka|Oka... Okabe...kun...
Moeka|What... do I have... to do?
Rintaro|Do you remember sending a D-Mail?
Moeka|A D... what?
Rintaro|D-Mail. An email that you send to the past.
Rintaro|You sent one to your own phone.
Rintaro|You led me to think it was about a phone model exchange, but you changed the text before you sent it.
Rintaro|Your D-Mail changed the past.
Rintaro|Don’t you remember?
Moeka|I... don’t know.
Rintaro|You do know. You just haven’t remembered yet.
Rintaro|Remember. Remember, or else.
Moeka|...
Moeka|I really... don’t know.
Moeka|If I could remember... I would...
Moeka|But I don’t... remember anything.
Rintaro|Fine. I’ll change the question.
Rintaro|You received a strange email about two weeks ago.
Moeka|...?
Rintaro|It came from your own number, and it was dated several days in the future.
Moeka|...!
Rintaro|You remember? Good. That was the D-Mail.
Rintaro|What did it say?
Moeka|If I tell you...?
Rintaro|I’ll return your phone.
Moeka|...Fuck... you...
Moeka|I won’t... tell you.
Rintaro|Why not!?
Moeka|It’s... my mission.
Rintaro|The IBN 5100.
Moeka|!!
Rintaro|It was about the IBN 5100.
Moeka|How much... do you know?
Rintaro|I’m asking the questions here. Just answer.
Moeka|I... can’t.
Moeka|I won’t... betray... FB.
Rintaro|So you’re choosing FB over your phone? How loyal.
Rintaro|Is it really that painful to not have your phone? Why are you so dependent on it?
Moeka|I can’t... talk to people.
Rintaro|You’re talking right now, aren’t you?
Moeka|If I can’t... use mail... then I’ll be...
Moeka|Cut off... from the world.
Rintaro|What? Are you fishing for sympathy? You’re just afraid of being abandoned by the Rounders, aren’t you?
Moeka|No... not the Rounders... FB.
Rintaro|Then don’t say ’the world.’ You’re the one who killed an innocent girl. You’re the one who erased Mayuri from the world!
Moeka|...I didn’t kill her.
Rintaro|Not on this worldline, maybe. But on another worldline, you came to steal our time machine. You killed her. You killed Mayuri!
Moeka|If FB told me to... then yes... I killed her.
Rintaro|Who is FB? Where the hell is he?
Moeka|I can’t... tell you...
Rintaro|Then let me tell you something.
Rintaro|Listen good. If you’re holding out for backup, you can forget it.
Rintaro|Nobody’s coming to save you. The pain and despair are just going to get worse, and in four days, you’ll kill yourself.
Rintaro|I came here from the future, using the time machine SERN wants so badly. That’s how I know.
Rintaro|You kill yourself in this room, all alone.
Rintaro|Your precious FB doesn’t save you. No one does. Not the Rounders, not SERN, and not the Committee of 300.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Your boss hasn’t replied to your mails, has he? You know why?
Rintaro|Because you’ve been abandoned.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|FB doesn’t deserve your loyalty. Tell me everything.
Moeka|FB wouldn’t betray me... FB wouldn’t abandon me!
Rintaro|Then why do you kill yourself in four days?
Moeka|You kill me... and make it look like a suicide...
Rintaro|I wouldn’t need to cover it up if I killed you. I’d just undo your death with my time machine.
Moeka|I...
Rintaro|When I got here, you were sitting in the corner like a limp rag, crying about how FB wouldn’t answer. Remember?
Moeka|But...
Rintaro|How many days has it been? How often did FB contact you before, and when did it stop?
Moeka|It used to be... every day...
Moeka|But it’s already been... ten days...
Rintaro|Ten days with no contact. Correct?
Moeka|I won’t... betray... FB...
Rintaro|FB betrayed you.
Moeka|I believe in FB...
Rintaro|He threw you away.
Rintaro|FB used you, and now your usefulness has ended.
Moeka|FB isn’t... like that...
Rintaro|Then what sort of person was he?
Moeka|She was gentle... to me... like a mother...
Moeka|I finally had... a place I belonged!
Moeka|I’d talk to her about my worries... she always replied right away...
Moeka|Like a friend... but gentle... accepting...
Rintaro|Have you met her?
Rintaro|You haven’t met? Even though she’s like your mother? Your friend?
Moeka|Rounders... must hide... their identities from one another...
Rintaro|So you’ve talked, but you’ve never met. But you must have wanted to meet her, right? Even if it was against the rules.
Moeka|No... no!
Moeka|It would ruin everything... if she saw the real me...
Rintaro|Did she ever say she wanted to meet you?
Moeka|No... never... and I never asked...
Rintaro|So no phone calls either, then?
Rintaro|Didn’t you wonder why?
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Why would such a kind, gentle woman refuse to meet you in person? Was it really just the rules?
Rintaro|And why isn’t she returning your emails now? Think about it.
Rintaro|She was using you. You were tricked.
Moeka|Don’t say that! She’s not... like that!
Rintaro|What did her last email say before she stopped contacting you?
Moeka|...’Leave the IBN 5100 at the designated location.’
Rintaro|What was the designated location?
Moeka|The coin locker... in front of Daibiru...
Moeka|*sob*...
Rintaro|I’m using your phone.
Moeka|...
Kurisu|Okabe!?
Rintaro|You at the lab?
Kurisu|Haah... don’t worry me like that... idiot...
Rintaro|What, were you worried about me?
Kurisu|I-I mean, you set off an obvious death flag. I’m surprised you’re still alive!
Rintaro|Where are you now?
Kurisu|I’m standing by at the lab.
Rintaro|Set up the machine. I’m sending another D-Mail.
Kurisu|Destination?
Rintaro|...July 31st, 11 AM.
Kurisu|11 AM on the 31st...
Kurisu|Okay, all set.
Rintaro|Alright, activate it.
Kurisu|Activated.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...Well?
Rintaro|Nothing. Why won’t it change!?
Kurisu|Another mistake?
Rintaro|No, there’s no way! I know what Moeka’s message said. This D-Mail should have canceled it.
Kurisu|What did the first D-Mail say?
Rintaro|That the IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine. I tried to cancel it by telling her it’s a trap, but it didn’t work.
Rintaro|I’ll try to phrase it differently.
Kurisu|Wait. We went through this with the LOTO SIX experiment, remember?
Kurisu|The person who reads the D-Mail chooses whether or not to act accordingly.
Kurisu|Kiryu learned that the IBN 5100 was at the shrine. Though the cancellation mail came right afterward, I guess she ignored it and went anyway.
Rintaro|Maybe she didn’t believe the cancellation mail. Or maybe she was so diligent she decided to check it out even when told not to.
Kurisu|Damn. Even when told it was too risky to go to the shrine, she went anyway...
Rintaro|We need a more persuasive message. Something that will prevent her from going to the shrine.
Kurisu|Like what?
Rintaro|What if I send a D-Mail to myself on July 30th? Could I beat her to the IBN 5100?
Kurisu|Were you even interested in the IBN 5100 then?
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|...FB.
Kurisu|What?
Rintaro|Moeka’s handler. She’s obsessed with FB. If the mail comes from FB, she’ll do whatever it says.
Kurisu|Do you have FB’s phone?
Rintaro|No. They haven’t even met. We don’t know where FB is.
Kurisu|Then there’s nothing we can do.
Rintaro|...Give me a little time.
Kurisu|Gonna make me wait again? Well, I’ve been pulling all-nighters recently, so whatever.
Kurisu|Just don’t do anything stupid, okay?
Rintaro|Looks like we’re searching for FB now.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|How exactly did you become a Rounder?
Moeka|...
Moeka|Four years ago... I tried... to kill myself.
Moeka|I had... no hope. I wanted to get away... from everything.
Rintaro|Why?
Moeka|...No big reason.
Moeka|Little things... lots of little things... piled up.
Moeka|I’ve always been... like this.
Rintaro|And your family?
Moeka|I locked myself in my room... and overdosed on sleeping pills.
Moeka|But I didn’t die.
Moeka|Afterwards... I got a mail.
Moeka|Recruiting Rounders, it said... It was sent to hundreds of people... not just me.
Moeka|Nothing mattered anymore... so on a whim... I replied.
Moeka|And then... FB contacted me.
Moeka|Ever since... I’ve followed... FB’s orders.
Rintaro|Were you always stationed in Akiba?
Moeka|Until three months ago... I was in Nagoya. Before that... Yokohama. Before that...
Rintaro|How many IBN 5100s have you found so far?
Moeka|Not even one...
Rintaro|So what now? Are you going to sit here, wallowing in despair, until you kill yourself four days from now?
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Or do you want to rebel against fate?
Moeka|Rebel?
Rintaro|FB used you and threw you away. Accept it. And then ask yourself what you’re going to do about it.
Moeka|...
Moeka|Even if FB... did use me...
Moeka|That... was the only place... I belonged.
Moeka|That was the first time... in my entire life... that I was needed.
Moeka|FB gave me... purpose.
Moeka|To protect that purpose... to protect FB...
Moeka|I would do... anything.
Rintaro|You’re beyond hope.
Rintaro|Drown in your dependence for all I care. Your death has already been decided.
Rintaro|But I won’t let fate have its way. I’m rebelling to the end.
Rintaro|The light’s on!
Rintaro|...Let’s not go crazy.
Rintaro|...!?
Rintaro|You put the IBN 5100 in the bottom-right locker. Correct?
Moeka|...How?
Rintaro|Out of all the lockers, only three could hold the IBN 5100. Out of those three, only the bottom one was in use.
Rintaro|If that’s the one you used, then FB hasn’t picked it up yet.
Rintaro|Do you know what that means?
Rintaro|It means that if we stake out the locker, you’ll get to meet FB.
Moeka|...ah.
Rintaro|It hadn’t occurred to you? Some secret agent you are.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|I’m headed there now. You coming?
Moeka|...
Moeka|What will you do... if you meet her?
Rintaro|Borrow her phone.
Moeka|I can’t meet her... I’m too afraid. The real me could never... live up to her expectations...
Rintaro|Something tells me her expectations were never that high to begin with.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|What are you doing here?
Moeka|I’ll... keep watch too.
Moeka|Is that... okay?
Rintaro|...Why the change of heart?
Moeka|...
Rintaro|You were comfortable with your mail-only relationship, weren’t you? I thought you wanted to maintain that distance.
Rintaro|So what made you decide to risk a meeting?
Moeka|At this rate...
Moeka|If I lose contact with FB... I’ll lose... my connection...
Rintaro|To the world?
Rintaro|You can’t bear to be alone yourself, yet you’d end an innocent girl’s life because some person you’ve never met told you to.
Rintaro|A cultist, that’s what you are.
Rintaro|What’s this?
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Whoa! Milk and bean buns!
Rintaro|You brought this for me?
Rintaro|Very well. You may join the stakeout.
Rintaro|Is that FB?
Moeka|FB... is a woman.
Rintaro|So... maybe she hired someone to pick it up.
Rintaro|Follow him!
Rintaro|Weird.
Moeka|He’s getting off...
Rintaro|Wha...!?
Rintaro|Clever...
Rintaro|They’ll make their move at Shinjuku.
Moeka|...?
Rintaro|That guy’s gonna get off, but he actually hands the package to someone else.
Rintaro|He got us good just now.
Moeka|Just now?
Rintaro|I just time leaped from an hour in the future.
Moeka|Time... leaped?
Station Announcer|Now arriving at Shinjuku.
Rintaro|I knew it!
Rintaro|Wha...
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Nervous?
Moeka|...
Rintaro|You look terrified. How long have you been driving?
Moeka|...First time.
Rintaro|What? This is your first time!? Oh come on... just don’t crash.
Rintaro|He’s coming!
Moeka|What does this mean?
Moeka|Where is FB?
Rintaro|The question is why did he bring it inside. Is he just holding onto it? Or...
Moeka|M4 is my codename...
Moeka|FB... gave it to me.
Rintaro|So... time for another stakeout.
Rintaro|It’s them!
Moeka|...
Moeka|What now?
Rintaro|Tennouji’s wife might be FB.
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|I thought I asked you to keep me posted.
Rintaro|I’ve been busy.
Kurisu|Busy. Right.
Rintaro|Were you worried about me?
Kurisu|O-of course not! Why should I care what you’re up to?
Kurisu|It’s just... Mayuri was really worried. I don’t want to see her sad.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|So at least give her a call, okay?
Rintaro|I’m doing this to save Mayuri.
Rintaro|I’m close to discovering our true enemy.
Kurisu|Our enemy? But...
Kurisu|Isn’t she our enemy?
Rintaro|She is an enemy, but we’re cooperating in order to uncover the truth.
Kurisu|Isn’t she the one who... killed Mayuri?
Rintaro|...Yes.
Kurisu|Whatever. So where are you going now? Take me with you.
Rintaro|Have you gone mad, assistant mine?
Kurisu|I’m perfectly sane, and I’m not your assistant.
Rintaro|It could be dangerous.
Kurisu|Eh...
Kurisu|Do I die today?
Rintaro|No. You don’t die.
Kurisu|Then there’s no problem. This worldline has essentially guaranteed my survival.
Tennouji|Make yerselves at home.
Rintaro|You’re an early riser, Mister Braun.
Tennouji|Yeah. Gotta see my little girl off to school.
Tennouji|I know it’s summer break, but habits die hard.
Rintaro|Is your daughter still asleep?
Tennouji|Hey. You thinking of trying something while she’s sleeping? Touch her and I’ll break your head, got it?
Rintaro|Don’t worry.
Rintaro|A few hours ago, six men stopped by this house to pick up a package, which they then delivered to France. You were there. I saw you.
Tennouji|And?
Rintaro|The package contained an IBN 5100. You know what that is, of course.
Tennouji|Yeah, the legendary retro PC.
Rintaro|Are you just another courier? Or are you...
Rintaro|A Rounder?
Tennouji|...
Tennouji|Did you betray us, M4?
Moeka|...!?
Moeka|No... are you... FB?
Tennouji|Ever heard of Ferdinand Braun?
Tennouji|C’mon, he was the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who invented the Braun Tube.
Tennouji|Ferdinand Braun. Initials?
Rintaro|...Ah!
Moeka|FB...!
Tennouji|Now you get it.
Rintaro|Wha...
Rintaro|Let me ask you one thing.
Rintaro|Your wife...
Tennouji|She died having Nae. Why?
Moeka|No... that can’t be...
Tennouji|I thought I was your world, M4. Now you’re running away?
Rintaro|So you’re a Rounder. SERN’s dog!
Tennouji|Their dog? Yeah... you ain’t wrong.
Rintaro|If you shoot, it’ll wake up your daughter.
Tennouji|So what?
Rintaro|Do you want your daughter to see you commit murder?
Tennouji|My little girl’s smart as a button. She’ll understand.
Rintaro|I can’t believe you’re a Rounder! You, of all people!
Rintaro|Hashida Suzu didn’t give you a home so you could turn it into a safehouse for SERN!
Tennouji|...
Tennouji|You knew Suzu-san? You should’ve said something!
Tennouji|Anyway, what gives you the right to speak for her, huh? She died ten years ago. You were what, eight?
Tennouji|How do you know how she’d feel?
Rintaro|...She told me.
Rintaro|She was here, in this time, not five days ago!
Suzuha|I’ll bring it to you here in Akihabara. That’s my duty, and I’ll see it through. The rest is up to you.
Suzuha|Change the future. Please.
Rintaro|She was right there, and you never knew it!
Rintaro|Hashida Suzu... no, Amane Suzuha was a time traveler! She came from the future to stop SERN!
Tennouji|...
Tennouji|Wha...t?
Rintaro|You never noticed, FB? The woman who saved your life came from the year 2036. She was one of us, a lab member, the daughter of Hashida Itaru.
Rintaro|Suzuha hated SERN! And here you are, a man who owes her everything, doing their dirty work!
Rintaro|Is this how you honor Suzuha’s memory!?
Tennouji|Stop making shit up!
Rintaro|How did you turn out this way?
Tennouji|Fuck you! It’s complicated.
Moeka|Are you... really FB?
Tennouji|Yeah, I am.
Moeka|The mails...
Tennouji|I wrote them. Why did I pretend to be a woman? Camouflage, obviously. Had to hide my identity.
Tennouji|The internet’s full of guys pretending to be girls.
Tennouji|I gotta say though, M4, you send too much goddamn mail.
Tennouji|Who has time for that shit? You better be grateful I bothered to reply.
Moeka|No...
Moeka|FB was like... a mother to me...
Moeka|I’d do anything for FB...
Tennouji|That was the point. It’s easy to manipulate nutjobs like you. Just gotta give ’em something to cling to.
Rintaro|Enough!
Moeka|Why did you... stop emailing me?
Tennouji|Huh? Oh, right. Your usefulness ended the second you dropped off that IBN 5100.
Moeka|I’m... useless?
Tennouji|Recruiting members directly is bad for secrecy, but the Rounders make up for it by choosing expendable assets with nowhere else to go.
Tennouji|Any member who finds an IBN 5100 is eliminated. No exceptions.
Tennouji|That way, SERN gets to keep their secrets, plus have a cheap army of outcasts like us.
Moeka|FB...
Tennouji|We’re all expendable, every last one of us. And it sucks, let me tell you.
Tennouji|As soon as our job’s done, they get rid of us. Guess that makes us cattle, not dogs.
Moeka|...Eh?
Tennouji|Disobey orders, and they go after your family. I can’t let them touch my little girl, can I?
Rintaro|Wait! Don’t--
Tennouji|Sorry for everything, Suzu-san.
Tennouji|Really, how did I turn out this way?
Moeka|Ah...ah...
Rintaro|Wh...y...
Moeka|No... why...
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|You fool...
Rintaro|You left your daughter all alone!
Rintaro|How could you die with a smile!?
Rintaro|...She’s gone?
Rintaro|...His phone.
Kurisu|...So the manager was FB.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|Hey, Moeka...
Rintaro|It’s possible... that FB did what he did so you could live.
Rintaro|Maybe he didn’t abandon you.
Rintaro|Maybe, by pushing you away, he was trying to keep you safe.
Moeka|...
Kurisu|Okabe! We need to send the D-Mail now.
Kurisu|Miss this chance, and you could be in a lot of trouble.
Kurisu|Your goal is to save Mayuri, not take revenge on SERN. Right?
Kurisu|...I don’t want anyone else to be hurt because of the machine we built.
Rintaro|...Yeah. You’re right.
Rintaro|Do you think Daru’s still in the lab?
Kurisu|I’ll try calling.
Kurisu|He said he’ll be there in five minutes.
Kurisu|By the way, something weird happened back there.
Kurisu|While I was waiting outside, I heard a gunshot.
Kurisu|And right after that... I saw her.
Rintaro|Her... who?
Kurisu|Nae-chan.
Kurisu|She ran out the back door.
Kurisu|When I called her to stop... our eyes met.
Rintaro & Kurisu|Wha!?
Rintaro|Wait! Don’t--
Nae|Hi!
Nae|...
Moeka|Guh...
Nae|Aha!
Nae|Ahaha!
Nae|Ahahaha!
Kurisu|No way...
Nae|Yes way.
Nae|I won’t forgive you.
Nae|Daddy died because of you.
Nae|I’ll never forgive you.
Nae|I’ll kill you with my own two hands.
Nae|Okabe Rintaro.
Nae|I’ll come for you in fifteen years. I hope you spend them quivering in terror.
Nae|Aha! Ahaha!
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|Wh-what the hell was that? A demon? Was she possessed?
Rintaro|W-what about Moeka!?
Kurisu|Calm down!
Kurisu|Check on Kiryu-san! I’ll call an ambulance.
Kurisu|No, wait! Before that...
Kurisu|Maybe you should just send the D-Mail.
Rintaro|Moeka!
Rintaro|Hang in there!
Rintaro|Can you hear me!? Moeka!
Moeka|...I... k...ed...
Moeka|I... killed...
Moeka|...someone...
Moeka|...precious... to you...
Moeka|This... is my punishment...
Moeka|I’m... sorry...
Moeka|I’m so...rry...
Moeka|I had... nothing... except FB...
Moeka|The only... place... I belonged...
Moeka|I would... kill... to protect it...
Moeka|You’re right... to hate me...
Moeka|I’m... so...rry...
Rintaro|I forgive you.
Rintaro|I forgive you.
Rintaro|I forgive you.
Moeka|...
Kurisu|...Okabe.
Kurisu|I think you should send the D-Mail.
Kurisu|Everything’s ready at the lab.
Rintaro|Yeah...
Rintaro|Hey, Christina.
Rintaro|When I send the D-Mail and change divergence, do you think Moeka’s fate will change?
Kurisu|Based on the attractor field model you spoke of...
Kurisu|She’ll be more likely to live if divergence exceeds 1%.
Kurisu|...Sorry. I wish I knew what to say.
Rintaro|Don’t worry about it.
Rintaro|...You’re alive.
Moeka|...?
Rintaro|What do you mean?
Rintaro|Your supervisor? You mean FB?
Moeka|...!
Rintaro|...
Tennouji|Doing your duty sets you up for disposal. So we’re more like cattle than dogs.
Nae|I won’t forgive you, until I kill you with my own hands.
Kurisu|...Okabe?
Rintaro|Wasn’t there something strange about that girl?
Kurisu|That girl... you mean Nae-chan?
Kurisu|...She was like a different person.
Rintaro|What did she mean, she’ll kill me in fifteen years?
Kurisu|Don’t worry about it, Okabe.
Kurisu|Send the D-Mail right now. That’ll solve everything.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|I can’t pretend I didn’t see that.
Rintaro|I’m time leaping. Back to the lab.
Kurisu|Our enemy? But...
Kurisu|Isn’t she our enemy?
Rintaro|...It’s about 7 AM, right?
Kurisu|Huh?
Kurisu|Well, yeah, but where did that question come from?
Kurisu|...!
Kurisu|There really was a gunshot...
Rintaro|Wait!
Rintaro|Stop!
Nae|...haah... ...ha ...ah...
Rintaro|Are you really Tennouji Nae?
Nae|...
Rintaro|You plan to kill Kiryu Moeka after this, don’t you?
Nae|That’s right.
Rintaro|Revenge for your father?
Nae|You and Kiryu Moeka killed Daddy.
Rintaro|Your dad killed himself. He blew his own brains out.
Rintaro|He would have done it even if we hadn’t been here.
Rintaro|It’s not our fault.
Nae|I don’t care.
Nae|Kiryu Moeka was there when Daddy died, but she didn’t stop him.
Nae|I won’t forgive her.
Nae|Nor you, Okabe Rintaro.
Nae|You weren’t there, but Daddy wouldn’t have died if you hadn’t gotten involved.
Nae|But I won’t kill you now. I can’t.
Nae|I’ll kill you in fifteen years. Keep living in fear until then.
Rintaro|Who... are you?
Rintaro|What do you mean, you’ll kill me in fifteen years?
Nae|Exactly what it sounds like.
Nae|Fifteen years from now, I killed you.
Nae|You still don’t get it?
Nae|Just now, you asked who I am.
Nae|I am Tennouji Nae. No doubt about that.
Nae|But I remember the next fifteen years.
Rintaro|Time leap!?
Rintaro|!!
Rintaro|Gh, aah...!
Nae|Ahahahaha!
Rintaro|Damn... it...
Nae|Wanna hear how I killed you?
Nae|In the future, you were one of the founders of the resistance against SERN.
Nae|But I captured you, and imprisoned you, and tortured you every which way I could think of!
Nae|You cried, and screamed, and begged for your life, all while covered in piss and shit! 
Nae|You were one sorry sight, Okabe Rintaro.
Nae|After I ran out of things to do, I finally slit your throat. And then I stabbed you! Over and over and over again, so many times I don’t even remember.
Nae|That’s how your life is going to end. That’s your punishment for murdering Daddy!
Rintaro|Ugahhh!
Nae|Aha!
Nae|SERN confiscated your Time Leap Machine. They kept it locked away for fifteen years. Until I came for it.
Nae|After I became a Rounder and killed you, I used that machine to come all the way back here.
Nae|It was hard, let me tell you. That piece of shit can’t leap more than 48 hours at a time.
Nae|2738 leaps.
Nae|I messed up a few times, though, so it was really more like twice that. At least. I kinda lost count after a while!
Nae|Revenge was all I lived for. I won’t let anyone get in my way. I will kill Kiryu Moeka with my own two hands.
Nae|I won’t let that bitch kill herself. She doesn’t deserve to go out easy.
Rintaro|You leapt fifteen years just for that?
Nae|Just for that?
Rintaro|Gah, gwaaah...!
Nae|It might not mean much to you, but to me, killing you two means everything!
Rintaro|So you kill Moeka... but what comes next?
Nae|Next?
Rintaro|Are you gonna repeat those fifteen years all over again?
Nae|Hmph. What do I care about those fifteen years?
Nae|There’s nothing for me there...
Nae|I don’t need anything from you now.
Nae|Just wait in fear and regret, Okabe Rintaro. Until I come for you in fifteen years.
Rintaro|Hahaha...
Kurisu|Okabe!
Kurisu|What happened!? Are you okay!?
Rintaro|The phone...
Kurisu|I brought it, but...
Kurisu|Hey, tell me what happened, will you!?
Kurisu|Should I call an ambulance!?
Rintaro|Calm down...
Rintaro|I’m gonna send the D-Mail now.
Kurisu|R-right. If the worldline changes, then this wound will go away.
Rintaro|Hey... why do you think Tennouji didn’t kill Moeka?
Kurisu|What do you mean?
Rintaro|I think... I think he wanted to save Moeka.
Rintaro|I hope it works out on the Beta worldline.
Rintaro|Sorry, Nae...
Rintaro|But I can’t let you have your revenge.
Moeka|Okabe-kun...
Moeka|How did you know where I...
Rintaro|Let me kill some time here!
Rintaro|What do you mean?
Rintaro|FB told you to stop...
Moeka|...!
Rintaro|...
Tennouji|Doing your duty sets you up for disposal. So we’re more like cattle than dogs.
Nae|Live in fear and regret, Okabe Rintaro. Until we meet again in fifteen years.
Rintaro|Have you been to Kiryu Moeka’s apartment?
Kurisu|...Huh?
Kurisu|Moeka-san’s apartment? Never.
Rintaro|Oh, okay.
Kurisu|Why do you ask?
Rintaro|It doesn’t matter. Just wondering.
Rintaro|It’s here!
Rintaro|Daru! Daru! Where’s my super hacka!?
Kurisu|Uh, he’s not here.
Kurisu|He went to ComiMa, remember?
Rintaro|Daru! Christina!
Rintaro|It’s time for the final phase of Operation Verthandi!
Rintaro|The IBN 5100, Daru!
Itaru|...Yeah?
Rintaro|Listen to me, man! We have an IBN 5100!
Itaru|Of course we do. You’re the one who found it, Okarin.
Rintaro|Yes! Yes I did! I found it at Yanabayashi Shrine!
Itaru|...Have you been drinking too much soda?
Kurisu|Let me sleep, for crying out loud.
Kurisu|I was up all night.
Rintaro|A question, Daru. Have you researched how to use the IBN 5100?
Itaru|Huh? Well, yeah, I guess.
Itaru|Can you believe I did it while preparing for ComiMa? I’m like a saint or something. They’d knight me for this in England.
Rintaro|Then we shall call you Sir Super Hacka!
Itaru|Hell no.
Kurisu|Will you guys shut up? You’re giving me a headache.
Rintaro|Hear me, lab mems!
Rintaro|Our long struggle has at last reached its climax! Ragnarok is at hand!
Rintaro|Now we must deliver the decisive blow. With the power of the IBN 5100, we shall crack SERN’s most secure database and destroy it from the inside!
Rintaro|Through the cowardly apparatus known as Echelon, the enemy has acquired precious intelligence on our activities. Now they plot to steal our sacred time machine, upon which rest the hopes and dreams of all mankind!
Rintaro|Beneath its scholarly trappings, SERN is a hive of scum and villainy, of men who would sacrifice innocent souls in their quest to rule all space and time. But now we are poised to crush them with the Hammer of Justice!
Rintaro|And when we do, they will know once and for all by whose hand the wheel of fate truly turns!
Rintaro|When the sun sets upon the battlefield, the foul System that rules the world will crumble! And from the flames, a new age will rise! An age of glorious, unfettered Chaos! 
Kurisu|Argh! Shut up!
Kurisu|What are you talking about!?
Itaru|Nobody can know the darkness in Okarin’s heart...
Kurisu|First, get your character straight! What kind of mad scientist talks about the Hammer of Justice?
Itaru|I guess he just got caught up in the heat of the moment. Maybe he regrets it now.
Rintaro|Come on, guys! Stop complaining and get ready!
Itaru|Get ready?
Rintaro|To crack SERN! Weren’t you listening?
Kurisu|Uh, I don’t think that’s a good idea.
Rintaro|When did you become a goody two shoes? Where’s your ambition!?
Kurisu|Are you trying to get us arrested?
Rintaro|That’s not the problem!
Rintaro|It’s taken me so long -- so long -- just to reach this point!
Rintaro|This is my chance to escape the Alpha worldline and save Mayuri. I won’t let anyone get in my way. Anyone!
Kurisu|Okabe...
Itaru|W-why so serious, man?
Rintaro|Please!
Rintaro|Please, hear me out.
Itaru|I-it’s not like I’m cracking for you or anything, okay!?
Kurisu|Oh god...
Rintaro|This all happened because of the very first D-Mail I sent to Daru.
Rintaro|SERN intercepted that D-Mail with Echelon and figured out what it meant, then sent their Rounders after us.
Rintaro|They will kill Mayuri, kidnap us, and steal the Time Leap Machine.
Rintaro|I tried to save Mayuri, but nothing worked. Every worldline converged on the same result, just as attractor field theory said they would.
Itaru|You know, if this is all in your head, I think you’ve got a career as a light novel author ahead of you.
Rintaro|It’s true. All of it.
Rintaro|To prevent Mayuri’s death...
Rintaro|We need to escape from the Alpha worldline. And I think we can do that by canceling all of our changes to the timeline so far.
Rintaro|That should return us to the Beta worldline, the worldline that existed before I sent that first D-Mail.
Rintaro|There’s just one more step. We need to erase the first D-Mail from SERN’s database.
Kurisu|Fascinating.
Itaru|You believe him, Makise-shi?
Kurisu|In theory. I’d like to see objective data, but that’s obviously impossible.
Rintaro|Relax. Your Time Leap Machine worked perfectly.
Kurisu|O-of course it did.
Kurisu|Besides, we were already planning to crack SERN’s database, weren’t we?
Kurisu|Fine. Let’s see what’s in there. If the mail data exists, then it’s proof that what you said is true.
Itaru|So what you’re saying is, ’don’t think, feel.’ Got it.
Kurisu|Uh, you lost me.
Rintaro|What he meant to say was, ’don’t think, do.’
Itaru|Done bridging them. I need to tinker with the settings a little, but we should be up and running in about ten minutes.
Rintaro|Alright.
Kurisu|So the first D-Mail started everything...
Kurisu|Was that the one you showed me at ATF?
Kurisu|The one that said I died or something.
Rintaro|Right. I found you dead at Radi-Kan and sent Daru an email. Daru happened to be experimenting on the PhoneWave (name subject to change) at the time, so the discharge phenomenon occurred and the mail... was...
Rintaro|...!
Kurisu|What?
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|And I’m supposed to choose?
Rintaro|There’s no way...
Rintaro|I can’t choose... I can’t!
Rintaro|Is this how it ends!?
Rintaro|Suzuha... Faris... Lukako... Moeka... Is this what I sacrificed your memories for!?
Rintaro|There’s no way...
Rintaro|I... can’t save her.
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Haah, we’re finally home♪
Rintaro|What are you gonna do now? Head straight home?
Mayuri|Actually, I was thinking of going to the lab.
Rintaro|Need something?
Mayuri|Not really, but it’s been a while since I got to relax with Okarin.
Mayuri|I’m a little hungry, so I’ll buy some Juicy Chicken Number One on the way.
Rintaro|Back to the lab, then.
Mayuri|Hey, Okarin. Why did you come with Mayushii today?
Mayuri|You’ve never come with me to ComiMa before. You’re not interested in moe, right?
Rintaro|I like robot anime.
Mayuri|So why did you come with me today?
Rintaro|Well...
Mayuri|Well?
Rintaro|...I just felt like it.
Mayuri|Oh...
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|...
Rintaro|Lukako...
Rintaro|I thought maybe you’d managed to get Lukako to cosplay, so I came to laugh at him. Too bad he didn’t come.
Mayuri|Yeah... Luka-kun would be super popular if he did come, though.
Mayuri|People would take his picture and post it all over the internet, then everyone in the world would see how cute he is!
Mayuri|And after he became a superstar, Mayushii would see him on TV and think, ’wow, he’s gone so far...’
Rintaro|It’s scary ’cause it’s true.
Mayuri|...Okarin?
Mayuri|Thank you for today.
Rintaro|Why are you thanking me?
Mayuri|Ehehe! Well, like I said, this is the first time Okarin’s ever come to ComiMa with me.
Mayuri|It made Mayushii really happy♪
Mayuri|Ah, but you know what would make me even happier? If you cosplay next time!
Rintaro|...Yeah, I’ll think about it.
Mayuri|Really? You’ll cosplay for me?
Rintaro|Only if you cosplay too.
Rintaro|Lukako too... and Christina, of course. Convince them to cosplay first.
Rintaro|If you manage that, then I, the great and insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, will grace ComiMa with my august presence.
Mayuri|Wow... that’s gonna be tough.
Mayuri|But it sounds really fun too!
Mayuri|Besides, I think Chris-chan secretly wants to cosplay. So there’s hope♪
Mayuri|Mayushii’s gonna do her best!
Rintaro|Wait here, Mayuri.
Rintaro|...?
Rintaro|Wha...
Mayuri|Okarin!!
Rintaro|!?
Rintaro|Mayuri!
Mayuri|O...kari...
Rintaro|Mayuri... I’m sorry. It’s my fault.
Mayuri|Finally... Mayushii was...
Mayuri|useful... to Okarin...
Rintaro|Wha...t?
Rintaro|Mayuri...
Rintaro|You can’t see the stars from here...
Rintaro|How could this happen?
Rintaro|What do you mean, you were finally useful? Tell me, Mayuri...
Kurisu|There you are.
Kurisu|What are you doing here?
Rintaro|...Nothing.
Rintaro|How did you know I was here?
Kurisu|You said you wanted to be alone. I ran the numbers and concluded that I had the greatest probability of finding you here.
Rintaro|Then leave me alone. You don’t have to look for me. I’m not a lost little boy.
Kurisu|H-hey! Is that how you treat someone who’s worried about you?
Kurisu|N-not that I’m worried about you or anything!
Kurisu|I was going to leave you alone at first.
Kurisu|But you’ve been acting weird the last couple days. I mean, you’re always weird, but more than usual.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|You look like a kid forced to eat crappy oatmeal. What happened?
Rintaro|Nothing...
Kurisu|Then why did you cancel the cracking of SERN?
Rintaro|You’re the one who said we shouldn’t.
Kurisu|Oh, so you’re afraid of triggering arrest flags. I get it.
Rintaro|You should praise me for obeying the law for a change.
Kurisu|That’s not like you at all. What happened to your ego? What happened to the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyo--
Rintaro|To hell with my ego!
Kurisu|...!
Rintaro|This time, it’s not that simple.
Rintaro|I have to choose which friend to let die. It would be so much easier if I knew what was right.
Kurisu|...Which friend to let die? What are you talking about?
Rintaro|I’m just a student, Christina. You know?
Rintaro|The insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma? That’s just a fantasy. A character I made up. I bet you had no idea.
Kurisu|Uh... I may have figured that out when we first met.
Rintaro|When we first met...
Kurisu|Tell me, Okabe. What do you mean?
Rintaro|...Do I have to tell you?
Kurisu|You’ve never hesitated to ask me for help before.
Kurisu|Don’t hold back now.
Rintaro|...Then prepare yourself.
Rintaro|What I’m about to tell you is the absolute truth.
Rintaro|And it could also be... your death sentence.
Kurisu|...eh?
Rintaro|Remember what I told you before? When we delete the D-Mail from SERN’s database, we’ll reach the Beta worldline, where Mayuri doesn’t die.
Kurisu|And where SERN doesn’t take over the world, right. Everyone lives. Everyone is free. You made it sound perfect.
Rintaro|Perfect? It’s anything but.
Rintaro|I showed you the first D-Mail, didn’t I? The one that started it all.
Rintaro|On the Beta worldline, the events described in that D-Mail actually happened.
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|Kurisu. On the Beta worldline...
Rintaro|You die on July 28th.
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|And according to the attractor field model, nothing can prevent that from happening.
Rintaro|If I want to save Mayuri, I have no choice... but to let you die!
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|Hey, Okabe.
Kurisu|How credible do you find this attractor field model?
Rintaro|Credible?
Kurisu|It’s all secondhand info from John Titor -- from Amane-san, isn’t it?
Kurisu|I get that it’s the accepted model in 2036.
Kurisu|But how exactly did scientists prove the existence of attractor fields?
Rintaro|Are you trying to say the model may be wrong? But I know for certain that convergence exists. I’ve experienced it firsthand.
Kurisu|Even if they’re right about convergence...
Kurisu|What about the relationship between worldlines?
Rintaro|The moment I change worldlines, everything is reconstructed. Past, present, and future.
Kurisu|But that’s just from your perspective, Okabe.
Kurisu|Once you go to the Beta worldline, the ’me’ that your brain perceives will die.
Kurisu|In other words, your perspective will have chosen the worldline where I die instead of the one where I don’t. However...
Kurisu|Why can’t the world your brain perceives be different from the world my brain perceives?
Rintaro|So you’re saying worldlines are independent?
Kurisu|Like trains, maybe.
Rintaro|Trains?
Kurisu|Um, let me give you an easy example...
Kurisu|If I want to take the train from Akiba to Yokohama, which route should I use?
Rintaro|I didn’t know you were a railfan.
Kurisu|It’s just an example. Geez.
Kurisu|You choose to take the Yamanote Line to Tokyo Station, then transfer to the Tokaido Main Line for the rest of your trip.
Kurisu|But I take the Yamanote Line to Osaki, then transfer to the Shonan-Shinjuku Line.
Kurisu|Another person -- say, Hashida-san -- might decide to take the Keihin Tohoku Line for some reason.
Kurisu|And Mayuri might ride the Shinkansen from Tokyo.
Kurisu|You and I ride the same train until Tokyo Station. But from there, we ride different lines, while still aiming for the same destination.
Rintaro|And that applies to the universe? You’re claiming the existence of parallel worlds?
Kurisu|...I like to use my imagination too, sometimes.
Kurisu|But where’s the proof that there’s only one world?
Rintaro|Suzuha said so... and then there’s Reading Steiner.
Kurisu|In other words, an unknown time traveler and your unexplainable super power.
Rintaro|But we knew Suzuha...
Kurisu|There’s no way to prove that she was Hashida’s daughter, or anything she said about 2036 either. Not without going there ourselves.
Kurisu|And if Reading Steiner is what you say, then it means that your subjective experience influences the memories of every single human being.
Kurisu|That’s completely absurd, Okabe. If it’s true, then you’re literally a god.
Kurisu|But there are no gods in reality.
Kurisu|The world doesn’t revolve around you.
Kurisu|It’s just your brain making you believe that it does.
Kurisu|If that makes you this world’s god, then I must be a god too. My brain is just as big as yours.
Rintaro|What are you trying to say?
Kurisu|Let’s say you choose the worldline where I die. That doesn’t mean I have to do the same.
Kurisu|The fact is that I am standing here right now, observing the world with my own subjectivity.
Kurisu|I already exist on a worldline where I don’t die.
Kurisu|Even if your perspective shifts to the Beta worldline, my perspective might remain here.
Kurisu|It’s a question of where the soul lies. And I won’t let you have your way with my soul.
Rintaro|No true scientist would accept a hypothesis that flimsy.
Kurisu|But there’s a chance I’m right.
Kurisu|So you have nothing to worry about.
Kurisu|The problem is that you don’t want to let me die, right?
Kurisu|But if my hypothesis is correct, I’ll still be alive on another possible worldline.
Kurisu|So there’s no reason to be afraid.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|It’s just a hypothesis.
Kurisu|The same is true of attractor fields.
Kurisu|It hasn’t been proven. Even if someone did prove it by 2036, that doesn’t help us here in the present.
Kurisu|In other words...
Kurisu|Anything is possible.
Kurisu|You really don’t have to worry about me, Okabe. It would just hurt my pride if you did.
Rintaro|Don’t say it like that.
Kurisu|Your phone’s ringing.
Rintaro|Oh, yeah. It’s Mayuri.
Kurisu|Answer it. I don’t mind.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|...Hello?
Mayuri|Ah...
Rintaro|Mayuri?
Mayuri|Yeah...
Rintaro|What’s wrong?
Mayuri|Um, I heard from Daru-kun that Okarin’s been acting kinda strange.
Mayuri|Mayushii was so preoccupied with ComiMa, she didn’t really notice...
Mayuri|Even though she usually notices right away when Okarin’s not happy...
Mayuri|I’m sorry, Okarin.
Mayuri|Um, did something happen?
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Okarin?
Rintaro|There’s... nothing wrong.
Mayuri|...
Mayuri|Oh...
Mayuri|You know, you used to talk to Mayushii about a lot of things, remember?
Mayuri|Like, umm, the Organization’s four leaders. Their names are Back Turkish, Virginian Burp, Balloon Drag Queen, and Wide-eye Gore, right?
Rintaro|...Black Tortoise, Vermilion Bird, Blue Dragon, and White Tiger.
Mayuri|Yeah, that!
Mayuri|You know, it was really fun talking to Okarin about stuff like that...
Mayuri|But now...
Mayuri|Um, Okarin? If Mayushii’s a burden... just say so, okay?
Rintaro|What!? I never...!
Mayuri|Ehehe. I’m hanging up now. If you feel like talking to Mayushii about anything, just call okay?
Mayuri|Tutturu♪
Kurisu|What did Mayuri say?
Kurisu|You’re such a wimp. I’m disappointed in you.
Rintaro|Aren’t you afraid of dying?
Kurisu|Did you not hear what I just said?
Rintaro|I heard, but--
Rintaro|How are you a burden!? Don’t say things like that, dammit!
Rintaro|Why is she only serious at times like this!?
Kurisu|A burden, huh...
Rintaro|I’ve never felt Mayuri was a burden. Not once.
Kurisu|Then you should tell her that.
Kurisu|Okabe.
Kurisu|The old you wouldn’t have worried about anything.
Kurisu|Anyway, you should go see Mayuri.
Kurisu|I’m sure she has a lot to say.
Mayuri|Hey, Granny.
Mayuri|I’ve been having scary dreams lately.
Mayuri|In my dreams, bad things keep happening to me.
Mayuri|Like someone shoots me, or a car hits me, or I get run over by a train...
Mayuri|It’s so real. It hurts so much, and I feel so sad, and I try to call for help but nothing comes out...
Mayuri|Why do you think I’m having these dreams?
Mayuri|And you know, they always end the same way...
Mayuri|Mayushii’s crying, and Okarin comes to save me.
Mayuri|Mayushii tries to say ’thank you, Okarin,’ but Okarin can’t hear my voice.
Mayuri|He holds Mayushii, and makes a very sad face like he’s going to cry. But he never does, you know? I can tell he’s forcing himself not to cry.
Mayuri|That makes Mayushii even more sad. I try to say ’sorry, sorry,’ but he still can’t hear.
Mayuri|And that’s when I wake up.
Mayuri|Why am I having these dreams?
Mayuri|Oh, right! We have a lot more lab mems now, you know!
Mayuri|There’s Chris-chan, Moeka-san, Luka-kun, and Feris-chan. There’s also Suzu-san, but she moved away.
Mayuri|That makes eight of us. It’s really amazing.
Mayuri|You know, it was just Okarin and Mayushii at first.
Mayuri|Back then, Okarin seemed kinda bored most of the time.
Mayuri|But now, he’s having so much fun.
Mayuri|And that makes Mayushii happy too!
Mayuri|It’s so busy, but it’s really exciting.
Mayuri|Especially now that Chris-chan is here. She’s really smart, you know. She got a paper published in a famous magazine!
Mayuri|Mayushii really admires her.
Mayuri|She even made a time machine! Oh, but can’t forget Okarin and Daru-kun helped too.
Mayuri|But you know, sometimes I remember...
Mayuri|Back when it was just the two of us.
Mayuri|When Mayushii had only just become Okarin’s hostage.
Mayuri|I’d go to the lab after school, but Okarin wouldn’t be there. So I’d tidy up the room, and decorate it with cute things. Then Okarin would finally show up a little later.
Mayuri|Mayushii would say ’welcome back’. But instead of saying ’I’m back,’ Okarin would say ’Good work,’ like a big boss or something.
Mayuri|Every day, we’d spend a few hours just hanging out, doing nothing, and then we’d go home together.
Mayuri|We didn’t talk much, but it wasn’t bad.
Mayuri|We were just there... together, you know?
Mayuri|We’d sit next to each other on the sofa. Okarin would work on his big plans, and Mayushii would read manga or play games.
Mayuri|And sometimes we’d have a snack together.
Mayuri|It was so nice and relaxing...
Mayuri|I never wanted to leave.
Mayuri|I’d start feeling like a real hostage, and I’d laugh ’ehehe’ to myself.
Mayuri|Then Okarin would turn to me and say...
Rintaro|Did something good happen?
Mayuri|Yup. Well, not really, but kinda.
Rintaro|Ah, it must have been an illusion. We could be under attack from Illusion Conductor, one of the Organization’s feared agents.
Mayuri|Oh... gotta be careful, then. But you know, I’m sure that Mr.Illusion Kidhugger--
Rintaro|Conductor. Not Kidhugger.
Mayuri|I’m sure he’s not a bad guy.
Mayuri|I felt so happy there.
Mayuri|So happy I could cry.
Mayuri|I wanted to stay like that forever.
Mayuri|Ah! But that doesn’t mean I don’t like how things are now, okay?
Mayuri|You know, I haven’t talked to Okarin much lately.
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Maybe Mayushii’s getting a little lonely.
Mayuri|But you know, I don’t want to be a burden on Okarin.
Mayuri|Mayushii’s just one big nuisance, isn’t she...
Mayuri|Um, Granny?
Mayuri|...I can’t stay like this forever, can I?
Rintaro|Of course you can!
Mayuri|Huh?
Mayuri|It’s Okarin♪
Mayuri|Wow, how’d you know I was here?
Rintaro|I always know where my hostage is.
Mayuri|Hostage...
Rintaro|You cannot escape my grasp. Not ever.
Mayuri|Oh...
Mayuri|But don’t wear yourself out, okay?
Mayuri|Mayushii’s a little worried.
Rintaro|...Hououin Kyouma is not so weak as to require your concern.
Rintaro|When the time comes, I’ll tell you everything.
Mayuri|...Huh?
Rintaro|So stay with me until then, like you always have.
Mayuri|...Okay.
Mayuri|Let’s head back, Okarin.
Rintaro|Shouldn’t we get some dango for ourselves first?
Mayuri|Ehehe! Of course♪
Rintaro|...!
Kurisu|...Okabe.
Rintaro|You’re alive...
Kurisu|Right. I forgot I might run into you here.
Rintaro|What were you doing?
Kurisu|...Thinking.
Rintaro|Oh...
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Looks like I’m in your way, so I’ll just go.
Kurisu|...Oh, okay.
Rintaro|Hey. It’s raining.
Kurisu|Huh? Oh, yeah.
Rintaro|Whoa!
Kurisu|What the hell!?
Kurisu|Whew, what a surprise.
Rintaro|That’s what you get for tempting the sky gods.
Kurisu|You should’ve warned me sooner. Even my underwear’s soaked.
Rintaro|Same here. I bet you’re glad it’s dark, huh?
Kurisu|What do you mean?
Rintaro|If the lights were on, I’d be able to see everything.
Kurisu|...!
Kurisu|Ugh, I forgot that you’re a perv too.
Rintaro|You’re the one who announced that your underwear was wet.
Kurisu|J-just drop it! If you’re imagining what color my underwear is, I’ll kill you!
Rintaro|I’m not imagining anything.
Kurisu|Achoo!
Rintaro|Cold?
Kurisu|I’m not stripping naked, if that’s what you’re suggesting! Your pervy tricks won’t work on me!
Rintaro|Who said strip!? Calm down, will you!?
Kurisu|Grr...
Rintaro|But if you want to strip, go right ahead. I can’t make out your scrawny figure in this light anyway.
Kurisu|Another word, and I’ll make you eat your cerebral neocortex with ponzu sauce!
Rintaro|S-sorry.
Kurisu|A storm like that shouldn’t last long. Guess we’ll just wait it out.
Kurisu|H-hey, get your own stair!
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|W-what?
Rintaro|You’re the one who said not to speak.
Kurisu|Y-you’re too close...
Kurisu|Don’t come any closer, okay? You can stay where you are, but come any closer, and I’ll push you away, okay?
Kurisu|...Don’t look at me.
Rintaro|Impossible! How can you see where I’m looking!?
Kurisu|So you were looking.
Rintaro|Damn. Must have caught on something when we ran inside.
Kurisu|What are you talking about?
Rintaro|Just a little tear in my coat.
Kurisu|Is clumsiness one of your character traits?
Rintaro|Don’t be ridiculous. I am a mad scientist. I bear the curse of insanity, not clumsiness.
Kurisu|Yeah, yeah.
Kurisu|Give it here.
Rintaro|What?
Kurisu|I happen to have a sewing kit with me. I’ll stitch it up for you.
Rintaro|A sewing kit? You?
Kurisu|Something wrong with that?
Rintaro|You’re an experiment-loving girl. You’re not supposed to be... domestic.
Kurisu|Can’t I be a domestic experiment-loving girl?
Rintaro|You? Domestic?
Kurisu|Relatively, maybe. Well, actually, I don’t know the domesticity index for Japanese high school girls these days.
Kurisu|It’s wet, so it’s kinda hard to thread.
Rintaro|...Did you really just happen to have that on you?
Kurisu|Get over it already. Is it really so wrong for me to have a sewing kit?
Rintaro|It’s not wrong. It just seems like you planned for this.
Kurisu|So you’re saying I brought it with me because I somehow knew your coat was going to get ripped. Uh-huh.
Kurisu|Ridiculous.
Kurisu|And before you get the wrong idea, I’m not fixing your coat because I want to or anything, okay?
Rintaro|Nice tsundere line.
Kurisu|Don’t mock me. You just happened to tear your clothes, and I just happened to have a sewing kit handy when you did. It’s coincidence. That’s all.
Rintaro|Coincidence...
Rintaro|Hey... you didn’t time leap, did you?
Kurisu|So now you’re saying that I went back in time for the sole purpose of repairing your stupid lab coat. Uh-huh.
Kurisu|Ridiculous. Ridiculous! There. It’s so important I said it twice. Comprendes?
Rintaro|You’re right. If you had time leaped, you would’ve brought a towel, not a sewing kit.
Kurisu|What’s that, sarcasm? All you do is complain.
Kurisu|Here.
Rintaro|Thanks.
Kurisu|Um, by the way... it was dark, so I couldn’t really see.
Kurisu|If it turns out bad, it’s not my fault. It was dark. That’s all.
Kurisu|Oh, and I hope you like the color. Because I have no idea which thread I used.
Rintaro|It’s... random?
Kurisu|Black, red, or pink. Those are the three possibilities.
Rintaro|Let’s just hope it’s not pink...
Kurisu|Achoo!
Rintaro|Cold?
Kurisu|I guess.
Rintaro|Take my coat.
Kurisu|But it’s wet.
Rintaro|Well, yeah, but...
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|...Have you made your decision yet?
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|Sigh... You still haven’t made up your mind?
Kurisu|You like Mayuri, don’t you?
Rintaro|What?
Kurisu|It’s probably just my imagination, but lately, I’ve been seeing things. Like a strange sort of deja vu.
Kurisu|In these visions, you’re fighting to save Mayuri all by yourself. You never give up, no matter how much it hurts.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|Then you come to me for help. You’re so desperate, so earnest, that I just have to do what I can.
Kurisu|N-not that I’m doing it for you, okay!? I just want to save Mayuri, that’s all.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|Anyway, these images are stuck in my head, like memories.
Kurisu|I tried self-analysis. Maybe I’m mistaking dreams for reality, projecting my hopes and fantasies... I don’t know.
Kurisu|But there’s one thing I do know.
Kurisu|You have to save Mayuri.
Rintaro|...Aren’t you afraid?
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|You know, it kinda feels like we’re trapped in an ancient ruin.
Kurisu|Like the world ended...
Kurisu|And we’re the only two people left.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|I’ve been thinking.
Kurisu|Say you go to the Beta worldline, and everyone else goes with you.
Kurisu|What if I can’t go with you? What if I’m the only one left behind?
Kurisu|Would the entire world become like this place?
Kurisu|It’s just a theory... but I can’t help but wonder.
Rintaro|I...
Rintaro|I’ll save you. Not just Mayuri, but--
Kurisu|Don’t make promises you can’t keep!
Kurisu|You asked me if I wasn’t afraid.
Kurisu|...Of course I’m afraid.
Kurisu|Maybe I’ll disappear. Maybe I’ll be left behind all alone.
Kurisu|Or maybe only you will disappear and everything else will stay the same.
Kurisu|The world will continue, and nobody will even know that you existed. I’ll go back to America as if nothing ever happened.
Kurisu|Maybe... maybe... maybe!
Kurisu|I feel hopeless, just thinking about all the possibilities.
Kurisu|But even so!
Kurisu|Do you think I would tell you to let Mayuri die!?
Rintaro|Kurisu...
Kurisu|Jesus, it’s cold!
Kurisu|It’s because of these wet clothes! This sucks.
Kurisu|Anyway, enough of this nonsense. It’s nothing but conjecture. Baseless. Worthless. I want to cut open my skull and excise the part of my brain that comes up with these delusions.
Kurisu|Listen, Okabe.
Kurisu|You can’t save both of us. Correct?
Kurisu|No matter how you struggle, it’s one or the other.
Rintaro|But...
Kurisu|No buts. My answer won’t change.
Kurisu|Save Mayuri.
Rintaro|Are you telling me to give up!? To abandon you!?
Rintaro|I could never do that!
Kurisu|You can, and you must! There’s no other way.
Rintaro|No! You’re our friend! I won’t abandon you!
Kurisu|Okabe!
Kurisu|Is there another solution? There isn’t, is there?
Kurisu|I don’t want to live if it means sacrificing Mayuri!
Kurisu|If you don’t save her, I’ll never forgive you!
Rintaro|Guh...
Kurisu|Eh...?
Rintaro|But you’re right here!
Rintaro|Why does it have to be this way!?
Kurisu|Okabe...
Kurisu|Thank you. I know you’re hurting for me.
Kurisu|But you’ve done enough. I’m fine, so just think about Mayuri, okay?
Rintaro|...I’m sorry.
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|I want to save Mayuri... more than anything.
Rintaro|I... can’t save you.
Kurisu|...I know.
Kurisu|Well then.
Kurisu|I’m heading back.
Rintaro|Back? Where?
Kurisu|The lab, of course. I need to dry my clothes. I wanna take a shower, too.
Kurisu|You stay here and soak for a while.
Kurisu|Understand?
Rintaro|...Understand.
Rintaro|Heh... heh heh heh...
Mayuri|Anyone here?
Mayuri|It’s Okarin!
Rintaro|What’s up?
Mayuri|Oh, nothing. I just decided to stop by. Ehehe♪
Mayuri|You know, I haven’t talked much with Okarin lately.
Mayuri|But you know, I don’t want to be a burden on Okarin.
Mayuri|Did you take a shower?
Mayuri|You smell good, like shampoo.
Rintaro|S-stop that!
Mayuri|You know... I didn’t go to ComiMa today.
Rintaro|Hm? Why?
Mayuri|I was thinking about Okarin.
Mayuri|When I got to Ariake, I remembered how sad you looked, and then I thought, ’I shouldn’t be having fun at ComiMa.’ 
Mayuri|So I turned around and came all the way back.
Rintaro|Oh... Sorry for making you worry.
Mayuri|...
Mayuri|You know, I haven’t talked much with Okarin lately.
Mayuri|Maybe Mayushii’s getting a little lonely.
Rintaro|Mayuri. How would you feel... if I said I was keeping a secret from you?
Mayuri|You mean like... Okarin and Chris-chan are actually dating?
Rintaro|Where did that come from?
Mayuri|Okarin and Chris-chan get along really well, right? I think you two are meant for each other.
Rintaro|...No, it’s nothing like that.
Mayuri|Oh... okay...
Mayuri|You don’t have to tell me everything, if you don’t want to.
Mayuri|Besides, it’s normal to keep secrets from your hostage.
Rintaro|This isn’t the time for that!
Mayuri|...
Mayuri|...Mayushii doesn’t want to be a burden.
Mayuri|So I’ll wait until Okarin’s ready to tell me.
Mayuri|Just like I said yesterday, remember?
Rintaro|...And if decide to never tell you?
Mayuri|Well, I’d be curious... really curious... but if that’s what you want...
Rintaro|Even if my secret involves you?
Mayuri|Mayushii?
Rintaro|I haven’t told you because I don’t want to hurt you.
Mayuri|...Is that why Okarin looks so sad all the time?
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Um, then I do want to know.
Mayuri|I don’t like it when Okarin’s sad.
Rintaro|Even if it means you might get hurt?
Mayuri|Yeah.
Mayuri|Mayushii doesn’t want to be a burden.
Mayuri|When Mayushii was sad because of what happened to Granny, Okarin took Mayushii hostage, remember?
Mayuri|That’s why Mayushii always thought. That whenever Okarin’s sad, she could lend her strength to him, you know?
Mayuri|Mayushii might not be useful, though...
Mayuri|Finally... Mayushii was...
Mayuri|useful... to Okarin...
Mayuri|I don’t want to see you hurting...
Rintaro|...Very well.
Rintaro|Take a seat.
Mayuri|Um, can I get some snacks?
Rintaro|This is serious, remember?
Mayuri|Oh... right.
Mayuri|Okay, ready.
Rintaro|...Everything I’m about to tell you is true. It’s related to those dreams you had.
Rintaro|I plan to sacrifice one of our friends for your sake.
Mayuri|Eh? Okarin?
Rintaro|Heh heh heh... you will soon regret your curiosity, my dear. For the deeds of the great Hououin Kyouma are many and terrible! Muhahaha!
Rintaro|By sacrificing Makise Kurisu, I will embark upon a journey to a glorious new world!
Rintaro|And that is the plan most grand and devious of the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma! I call it... Made in Heaven! Muhahahaha!
Mayuri|...
Rintaro|...What’s the matter?
Mayuri|...
Mayuri|The whole time you and Chris-chan were hurting...
Mayuri|Mayushii was making costumes... like nothing was wrong...
Mayuri|I feel so stupid!
Mayuri|I didn’t know anything!
Rintaro|O-of course you didn’t! That’s how I planned it.
Rintaro|Are you disappointed in me, Mayuri? Sorry, but this is who I am. I will do anything, sacrifice anyone to accomplish my goals. Whether you like it our not, you’re coming with me to the Beta worldline. 
Rintaro|You’re my hostage, and you have no say in the matter. Heh heh heh!
Rintaro|Let chaos descend upon the world! That is the choice of Steins Gate!
Rintaro|Where are you going!?
Mayuri|I need to see Chris-chan!
Mayuri|Please, Okarin. I have to talk to her!
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|Thanks for coming to see me off.
Rintaro|Does that suitcase mean what I think it does?
Kurisu|Hm? Oh. Yeah, it does.
Rintaro|You’re going back to America.
Kurisu|I was supposed to go back at the beginning of the month. But then I ran into a certain mad scientist, and ended up staying longer than planned.
Kurisu|There’s nothing else I can help you with anyway. And I don’t want to be a liability.
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|...
Kurisu|What’s wrong, Mayuri? Are you feeling sick?
Rintaro|C’mon, Mayuri.
Mayuri|...
Mayuri|Chris-chan!
Kurisu|W-whoa, what’s going on!?
Mayuri|Mayushii doesn’t want Chris-chan to disappear!
Mayuri|You can’t disappear. Not for Mayushii! Okay?
Rintaro|Mayuri...
Mayuri|Mayushii doesn’t want to live if Chris-chan has to die!
Rintaro|This is the way it has to be. I chose you, Mayuri. You have an obligation to live.
Rintaro|Kurisu and I made a pact. She agreed to trade her life for yours. If that sacred covenant is broken, this world is doomed!
Rintaro|Don’t put Kurisu’s feelings to waste, Mayuri!
Mayuri|But... but...
Kurisu|Thank you, Mayuri.
Kurisu|But this was my decision too. I’m okay with it. Really.
Kurisu|Okabe loves you, you know.
Mayuri|Wha...?
Rintaro|Wh-wh-wha-what are you saying!?
Kurisu|It’s true, isn’t it?
Kurisu|It would make him really sad if you died. You don’t want him to be sad, do you?
Mayuri|But if Chris-chan goes away, it’ll make Mayushii sad...
Kurisu|Yeah... I know. It makes me sad too.
Kurisu|But this was going to happen eventually. I had to go back to America sooner or later.
Kurisu|So even if you move to another worldline, just think of me as being in America. It’s practically the same thing.
Mayuri|That’s not the problem! I don’t want Chris-chan to disappear!
Mayuri|Let’s stop this, okay? Don’t make Chris-chan disappear!
Kurisu|You have to listen to us now, Mayuri.
Kurisu|Okabe. Don’t ever let go of her again.
Rintaro|...I know.
Kurisu|Well, I’m off.
Kurisu|Thank god I’ll never have to see your silly face again!
Mayuri|Don’t go, Chris-chan! Please, don’t go!
Kurisu|Don’t follow me!
Kurisu|I don’t want pity. It will only make it worse.
Kurisu|This is my decision. Nothing you can say will change my mind.
Mayuri|...
Kurisu|...Goodbye.
Kurisu|Promise me, Mayuri. Promise me you’ll find happiness.
Mayuri|I’m sorry... I’m sorry... I’m sorry...
Rintaro|You have nothing to apologize for. This was my decision, and mine alone.
Rintaro|Kurisu will disappear, for I chose not to save her.
Rintaro|I chose... to bring chaos to the world.
Rintaro|You can’t forgive me, can you, Mayuri? Then hate me.
Rintaro|But even then, you’re staying with me to the end.
Rintaro|I have chosen.
Rintaro|To save you, I will let Kurisu die.
Rintaro|So hate me, loathe me, curse my name...
Rintaro|But I... will not turn back.
Rintaro|Nobody can stop me now.
Mayuri|Sniff... Okarin?
Mayuri|Tell me how you really feel...
Mayuri|I want to know what’s in your heart... your honest feelings...
Mayuri|Mayushii doesn’t want to be a burden any more.
Rintaro|You’re not a burden! How can you think that!?
Rintaro|This is about me. Because I want to save you, because I can’t bear to lose you!
Mayuri|Yeah... Thank you, Okarin... thank you...
Mayuri|I’ve been having scary dreams lately.
Mayuri|In those dreams, you always try to save me.
Mayuri|They weren’t dreams, were they?
Mayuri|You were fighting to save Mayushii, weren’t you?
Mayuri|Um, Okarin? You know...
Mayuri|Mayushii loves you.
Mayuri|Mayushii can smile every day because you’re there for me.
Mayuri|Can we be together from now on, too?
Rintaro|Of course.
Rintaro|How can you ask that?
Rintaro|I don’t want to be apart from you either!
Mayuri|Yeah...
Mayuri|Mayushii will find happiness.
Mayuri|Just like I promised Chris-chan.
Rintaro|Yeah.
Mayuri|Let’s be happy together...
Rintaro|We will.
Mayuri|Never let go of me...
Rintaro|I won’t!
Mayuri|Let me love you forever...
Rintaro|Of course.
Rintaro|The time has come. We will now commence the final phase of Operation Verthandi.
Rintaro|Daru. You may begin.
Itaru|...You sure?
Rintaro|...Yeah.
Itaru|Okey-dokey!
Itaru|Okarin, I found it! It’s really there!
Rintaro|The D-Mail I sent? It’s there!?
Itaru|It sure is, man.
Mayuri|Okarin...
Rintaro|It’s okay.
Itaru|Everything’s set. One press of the enter key, and that data’s gone.
Itaru|I leave that honor to you, Okarin.
Rintaro|Victory is at hand!
Rintaro|With unimaginable brilliance and unwavering conviction, I have defeated our vast and powerful enemy and now stand triumphant on the field of Ragnarok!
Rintaro|I give thanks to the comrades... whose sacrifice made this victory possible!
Rintaro|The coming world... is the world I wished for!
Rintaro|This is the choice of Steins Gate!
Rintaro|El Psy Kongroo!
Rintaro|Let the world be reborn!
Mayuri|What’s wrong, Okarin?
Rintaro|Say, Mayuri.
Mayuri|Yeah?
Rintaro|...Who was Lab Mem 004 again?
Mayuri|004? But Okarin, there’s only three lab mems, remember? Okarin, Mayushii, and Daru-kun.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Yeah... right. Our lab doesn’t have a fourth member. It never did...
Mayuri|Okarin? Something really sad happened, didn’t it?
Mayuri|Mayushii is here for you, Okarin.
Mayuri|Okarin... don’t cry...
Rintaro|Please don’t leave me, Mayuri... Please... stay by my side... forever...
Mayuri|Mayushii will always be with you...
Mayuri|Always. Just like this...
Mayuri|Okarin♪
Mayuri|Ah... sniff...
Rintaro|Wh-why are you crying!?
Mayuri|...
Mayuri|Okarin came to pick me up...
Mayuri|You waited for Mayushii... I’m so happy!
Rintaro|Don’t get so happy over every little thing.
Mayuri|Ehehe♪
Mayuri|So Mayushii class-changed from Hostage to Girlfriend, right?
Rintaro|...Indeed.
Mayuri|Thank goodness... It wasn’t just a dream.
Rintaro|Let’s get going, already. I’m gonna die standing in this damn heat.
Mayuri|But the lab’s hot too, isn’t it?
Rintaro|At least we’ve got a fan. And besides, I’m thirsty. Gotta get my daily dose of Dr P.
Rintaro|Mayuri?
Rintaro|Mayuri!
Rintaro|Mayuri!
Mayuri|Over here!
Mayuri|Ehehe♪ You said it was hot, remember? I thought it’d be nice to eat something cold!
Rintaro|Don’t scare me like that!
Rintaro|Hold my hand.
Mayuri|Okay.
Rintaro|Let’s save the shaved ice for when we get to the lab. It’s too hard to eat while walking.
Mayuri|Ehh? But won’t it melt?
Rintaro|If it melts, it melts.
Mayuri|Oh... well, I guess you’re right. We can’t eat if we’re holding hands, anyway.
Rintaro|I won’t let go! I won’t ever let you go!
Mayuri|Mayushii won’t let go either♪
Mayuri|Okarin?
Mayuri|Is it possible to dream when you’re awake?
Rintaro|When you’re awake? You mean a daydream?
Mayuri|Is that what it’s called? You’re so smart!
Mayuri|Um, I don’t know who it was, but Mayushii feels like she had a very important friend.
Rintaro|What...?
Mayuri|And whenever I think about that important friend, my heart hurts, like hnng, you know?
Mayuri|And sometimes, I hear a voice.
Rintaro|A... voice?
Mayuri|The voice tells me to ’find happiness.’
Rintaro|Ah...
Mayuri|I wonder if that voice is the reason Mayushii’s with Okarin now...
Mayuri|If I ever meet that person, I want to tell them thanks.
Mayuri|I wonder who it was.
Rintaro|...It must have been God.
Mayuri|Oh... well, thanks, God!
Mayuri|Mayushii’s really happy.
Rintaro|I won’t give up. Ever!
Kurisu|...Kuh!
Kurisu|This is ridiculous! You... motherfucker!
Rintaro|Whoa!
Kurisu|I said I was fine! What do you mean you won’t give up!? Are you stupid? Wanna die?
Kurisu|Are you trying to be a hero, you chuunibyou wackjob? Don’t make promises you can’t keep!
Kurisu|Your stupidity is infuriating! Why can’t you just do as I say!?
Rintaro|I...
Kurisu|What’s the problem, huh!? If you weigh the options logically, saving Mayuri is the only--
Rintaro|Fuck logic!
Kurisu|...!
Rintaro|I’m not God! Maybe I got close, but that’s not me!
Rintaro|I can’t decide who lives and who dies anymore!
Rintaro|This time...
Kurisu|Hmph!
Kurisu|There’s nothing you can do. It’s the choice of Steins Gate. Isn’t that what you always say?
Kurisu|The equation is proven, Okabe. There’s no escape.
Kurisu|You’re just one man. No matter how hard you try, you can’t overcome the will of the universe.
Rintaro|I know... but I’m still going to try!
Kurisu|Kuh...
Kurisu|Have it your way! But I’m not helping. I’m going back to America, and that’s that.
Kurisu|Goodbye. I don’t expect we’ll meet again, Hououin Kyouma.
Rintaro|Kuh...
Kurisu|I can’t believe this! How stupid can you be? You’re so... stupid!
Kurisu|Running away?
Rintaro|Why...
Kurisu|Time leaping is just running away.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|I’ve hurt people... lots of people... just to save Mayuri.
Rintaro|And yet, I don’t even feel guilty anymore.
Rintaro|I feel like I’m losing my humanity.
Kurisu|Then why are you hesitating now?
Rintaro|...Maybe because my insurance, the Time Leap Machine, isn’t effective.
Rintaro|Or maybe I just haven’t mastered it yet. Maybe I haven’t tapped into its full potential.
Kurisu|Running only makes it hurt more.
Kurisu|I should know.
Kurisu|Look at yourself, Okabe. You look like you’ve aged a decade.
Kurisu|Your heart can’t take it anymore. You don’t need to beat yourself up like this. Just accept the truth.
Kurisu|Like I said, you can’t stay here.
Kurisu|Go to the Beta worldline. Go to the world where Mayuri doesn’t die.
Kurisu|Not just for your sake, but for mine as well.
Kurisu|Hey! Could you not talk about me like that? I’m perfectly fine.
Kurisu|Let’s say we wanted to make a machine that could physically transport people through time. What would we need?
Kurisu|Who the hell’s Christina!? I never said that!
Kurisu|I don’t want to deny who I’ve been. Because even my failures are a part of who I am today.
Kurisu|We may have created a monster here...
Kurisu|You said I was your friend, remember? You said I was important to you. That made me really... happy, I guess...
Kurisu|Once we’re done upgrading the PhoneWave... I want you to come with me.
Kurisu|I want to be your strength.
Kurisu|Thank you. I know you’re hurting for me.
Rintaro|I...
Rintaro|...can’t save you.
Rintaro|I’m sorry...
Rintaro|Why does it have to be you? Why!?
Kurisu|Hey, Okabe.
Kurisu|Once you go to the Beta worldline, Mayuri and Hashida will forget the time we spent together, right?
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|Will you... remember me?
Rintaro|Of course I’ll remember you. Of course I will!
Rintaro|There’s no way I could ever forget the girl most important to me!
Kurisu|Eh? Y-you mean...
Kurisu|Wh-what the hell are you saying!?
Rintaro|The truth.
Kurisu|B-but... proof. I need proof. I can’t come up with a formula otherwise!
Kurisu|When the anterior pituitary gland hypersecretes ACTH, and gamma waves induce stochastic resonance, we can assume an infinite Hausdorff dimension for the Hilbert curve.
Kurisu|That is, we can measure the asymptotic line with positron emission tomography...?
Rintaro|Kurisu.
Rintaro|I love you.
Kurisu|...!
Rintaro|And you?
Kurisu|Eh!? Wh-what!?
Rintaro|Do you, uh... How do you feel about me?
Kurisu|Y-you want to know?
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|Close your eyes!
Rintaro|Why close my--
Kurisu|Just shut up and close them!
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|nn...
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|Wha... wha...
Kurisu|I-it’s not like I did it... because I wanted to or anything.
Kurisu|It’s just... you promised... that you wouldn’t forget about me.
Kurisu|Research shows that memories are harder to forget when coupled with intense emotions.
Kurisu|Y-you’re a virgin and a perv, so I was sure you’d have an elaborative rehearsal on your first kiss, instantly making it a long-term memory you’d never forget... so...
Kurisu|I just don’t want you to forget about me, Okabe. No matter what.
Rintaro|S-sorry to disappoint you.
Kurisu|...eh?
Rintaro|That wasn’t my first kiss.
Kurisu|W-why you... You’re just a cherry boy!
Rintaro|Shut up, virgin.
Kurisu|So it wasn’t your first...
Rintaro|Right. So it only left a weak impression. Probably not enough to become a long-term memory.
Rintaro|So, once more.
Kurisu|Wha...
Rintaro|I don’t ever want to forget... so let’s make doubly sure.
Kurisu|Th-then I guess there’s no choice...
Kurisu|Just a kiss... okay?
Kurisu|Be gentle... okay?
Kurisu|Okabe...
Kurisu|Mm...
Kurisu|Don’t forget me...
Kurisu|mm...
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|It’s too fast...
Kurisu|Time is going by too fast.
Kurisu|I could really use a word with Einstein right now.
Kurisu|Time is not absolute.
Kurisu|Einstein proved that time could be fast or slow, depending on the observer.
Kurisu|Hey, Okabe.
Kurisu|The theory of relativity is so romantic...
Kurisu|...and so sad, don’t you think?
Kurisu|...Well then.
Rintaro|Are you sure I shouldn’t call Mayuri and Daru?
Kurisu|...I think that would just make it harder.
Kurisu|But you, I have no trouble leaving behind.
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|...That was a joke.
Rintaro|This is a souvenir. Take it.
Kurisu|Uh... no thanks.
Rintaro|Just take it. It’s not even that bulky.
Kurisu|Oh, fine. I guess I’ll take it.
Rintaro|Sorry I couldn’t go with you to Aomori...
Kurisu|Yeah...
Kurisu|But these two weeks were fun, in their own way.
Kurisu|Give my regards to Mayuri and Hashida, okay?
Kurisu|Hang in there, Okabe.
Rintaro|...Stay well.
Rintaro|I...
Rintaro|I will remember you, Makise Kurisu. I will remember your warmth.
Rintaro|I will never forget!
Rintaro|The time has come. We will now commence the final phase of Operation Verthandi.
Rintaro|Daru. You may begin.
Itaru|...You sure?
Rintaro|...Yeah.
Itaru|Okey-dokey!
Itaru|Okarin, I found it! It’s really there!
Rintaro|The D-Mail I sent? It’s there!?
Itaru|It sure is, man.
Mayuri|Okarin...
Rintaro|It’s okay.
Itaru|Everything’s set. One press of the enter key, and that data’s gone.
Itaru|I leave that honor to you, Okarin.
Rintaro|Victory is at hand!
Rintaro|With unimaginable brilliance and unwavering conviction, I have defeated our vast and powerful enemy and now stand triumphant on the field of Ragnarok!
Rintaro|I give thanks to the comrades... whose sacrifice made this victory possible!
Rintaro|The coming world... is the world I wished for!
Rintaro|This is the choice of Steins Gate!
Rintaro|Let the world be reborn!
Kurisu|--!
Kurisu|Goodbye.
Kurisu|Okabe, I lo--
Rintaro|...Hey, who was Lab Mem 004 again?
Mayuri|Okarin, there isn’t a 4th lab mem, remember?
Itaru|Are you going to introduce a new member? Requesting cute girl.
Rintaro|...No.
Rintaro|Heh... heh heh... MUHAHAHAHA!
Rintaro|The last battle of Ragnarok is won!
Rintaro|I, the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, with an IQ rivaling that of Einstein himself, have thwarted the Organization, outsmarted SERN--
Rintaro|And conquered the whole of space and time! Now, at the moment of my triumph, I stand before you as a god!
Rintaro|This brave new world is the fruit of my ambition! The hated System shall collapse, and chaos shall rule the Earth!
Rintaro|This truly is the choice of Steins--
Mayuri|Okarin.
Mayuri|It’s okay now.
Rintaro|Wha... what are you saying? I must proclaim our glorious victory, that all may--
Mayuri|But Okarin... you look like you’re about to cry.
Rintaro|...!
Mayuri|You don’t have to try so hard, okay? I know you’re doing it for me, but I don’t want to be a burden.
Mayuri|So you don’t have to pretend anymore, okay?
Mayuri|If you’re hurting, just say so. Like normal Okarin would.
Rintaro|But... I...
Mayuri|You don’t have to worry about Mayushii anymore.
Mayuri|Mayushii is fine.
Mayuri|So you can cry if you want to, okay?
Mayuri|I don’t know what happened...
Mayuri|But it’s okay to cry now.
Rintaro|...
Itaru|Whoa, man. Are you really crying?
Rintaro|I... I...
Rintaro|Phew. That’s that.
Itaru|Man, what a waste. That thing was worth a fortune.
Mayuri|And now we don’t have a microwave...
Mayuri|How will Mayushii eat her Juicy Chicken Number One?
Rintaro|Come on. I’ll get you a new microwave.
Kurisu|I don’t want to deny who I’ve been. Because even my failures are a part of who I am today.
Kurisu|Going to the past is possible right now. Look into the sky at night, and you can see how things were tens of thousands of years ago.
Rintaro|No way...
Mayuri|Wow! What’s that?
Itaru|It’s a robot, right? The transforming kind?
Rintaro|Ah...!
???|...
???|...Okabe Rintaro?
Rintaro|Suzuha!
Rintaro|Why are you here!?
Suzuha|Are you Okabe Rintaro? I need to know.
Rintaro|Y-yeah...
Rintaro|Hold on. Just hold on one second.
Suzuha|I’m a time traveler from the year 2036. I have a request for Uncle Okarin.
Mayuri|You’re an uncle?
Suzuha|This worldline is headed for World War Three!
Suzuha|I need your help to prevent it! Please, help me change the future!
Rintaro|Wha... what the...
Rintaro|What the hell are you talking about!?
Mayuri|World War Three? Oh no! That’s really bad!
Itaru|Uh, are you really a time traveler? You’re not just messing with us here?
Suzuha|Stay out of this, Dad.
Itaru|D-Dad!?
Itaru|W-whoa... that was a shock. I mean, it’s not every day a mysterious beauty calls me dad. Though to be honest, I’d prefer to be called big brother.
Rintaro|Wait! Everyone just wait! Let me think!
Rintaro|Is that thing a time machine?
Rintaro|Your father built it?
Suzuha|That’s right.
Rintaro|Where did you come from?
Suzuha|The year 2036.
Suzuha|I stopped in 1975 and 2000 first.
Rintaro|You... what?
Rintaro|That time machine can travel to the future!?
Suzuha|It wouldn’t be much of a time machine otherwise.
Rintaro|You’re... from a different future?
Suzuha|A different future?
Rintaro|What’s going on in 2036? What about SERN’s dystopia?
Suzuha|SERN? What’s that?
Rintaro|You said something about World War Three?
Suzuha|Right. In my time, humanity has been reduced to less than a billion people.
Itaru|Less than a billion? But the population now is like 6.7 billion. Are you saying 5.7 billion people died!?
Suzuha|That’s what happens when you use nuclear weapons.
Suzuha|It was just like the Cold War. Only this time, they were fighting over time travel technology.
Suzuha|It started with a race between the EU and Russia. Then the Americans got involved, and things really went to hell.
Suzuha|They were all desperate to stop anyone else from being first to build a time machine. Whoever controls time controls the world, right?
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|By 2036, the war’s over, but it left the Earth in ruins. We won’t survive for long, not as things are.
Rintaro|This can’t be happening...
Mayuri|Are you okay?
Rintaro|Why is this happening!?
Rintaro|You lied to me! You said a peaceful future was waiting for us on the Beta worldline!
Suzuha|We’re at a point of great divergence, when--
Rintaro|I know that already!
Suzuha|Then you understand! 5.7 billion people are going to die, and the survivors will be left with no future! No hope!
Suzuha|I came here to prevent that. And to do that, I need your help, Uncle Okari--
Rintaro|I refuse!
Suzuha|--!
Rintaro|I came here from the Alpha worldline. I had to sacrifice the girl I loved to make it this far!
Rintaro|I don’t care if 5.7 billion people die! I won’t let her... I won’t let Kurisu’s sacrifice be in vain!
Suzuha|Wait. You mean you’ve been to another attractor field?
Suzuha|Wow. So that’s the power of Reading Steiner.
Rintaro|...How do you know about that?
Suzuha|Dad told me. And I’ve met you before, Uncle Okarin. In the future, that is.
Rintaro|You’ve... met me?
Suzuha|I see... so the me of that attractor field went to the past too...
Suzuha|Uncle Okarin. I know you don’t want to, but--
Rintaro|No. I won’t let Kurisu’s death be in vain. I won’t let Mayuri die.
Mayuri|Huh? Mayushii dies?
Suzuha|By Kurisu, I assume you mean Makise Kurisu?
Suzuha|Listen, Uncle.
Suzuha|Let’s say -- hypothetically -- that the only way to change the future of this worldline is to go to July 28th, 2010, the day Makise Kurisu dies...
Suzuha|...and save her. What would you do?
Rintaro|What!?
Rintaro|Ah...!
Rintaro|Your time machine... We can use your time machine!
Suzuha|The worldline I’m aiming for isn’t... what did you call it? The Alpha worldline? It’s not that.
Suzuha|What we’re aiming for...
Suzuha|Is the space between attractor fields.
Suzuha|There lies a worldline unaffected by any attractor field.
Suzuha|A worldline known as Steins Gate.
Rintaro|Wha...
Suzuha|I was told that Steins Gate is a brand new worldline, one no one has ever observed.
Itaru|But didn’t someone have to observe it to know it’s there?
Suzuha|Nope. It’s never been observed. That’s what makes it new.
Suzuha|But Dad and Uncle Okarin were able to calculate its divergence.
Suzuha|-0.086109% relative to the current worldline.
Suzuha|That’s where we’ll find Steins Gate.
Rintaro|And to reach that worldline, we have to save Kurisu?
Suzuha|Exactly.
Suzuha|She’s the key to averting World War Three. As long as she lives, the war won’t happen. Or at the very least, 5.7 billion people won’t die.
Rintaro|Why?
Suzuha|Huh?
Rintaro|Why Kurisu? I mean, I know she’s a genius, but are you telling me she’s the hero who’ll save 5.7 billion people?
Suzuha|...I don’t know.
Rintaro|You don’t know? And you expect me to go along with this!?
Suzuha|Hey, I’m just following Dad’s plan.
Suzuha|And apparently, you’re the one who came up with it in the first place.
Suzuha|If there’s a flaw in your plan, then we’re all in trouble.
Rintaro|It sounds like you didn’t hear it from me. Is that right?
Suzuha|You passed away ten years ago -- 15 years from now, that is. The year 2025.
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|So I don’t know the whole story. What I do know is that my dad continued your work. After you died, he built this time machine all by himself just to see your plan through.
Itaru|...?
Suzuha|Uncle Okarin.
Suzuha|Like I said, Steins Gate is unobserved. Nobody knows what future awaits us there.
Suzuha|There’s a chance that a dystopia rises from the ashes of World War Three.
Suzuha|There’s a chance that Makise Kurisu dies just two days after you save her.
Suzuha|There’s a chance that you don’t die in 2025, but next week.
Suzuha|But there’s also a chance that when 2036 comes, there will be no dystopia, no world ravaged by war.
Suzuha|There’s a chance that everyone, including Makise Kurisu, will still be alive.
Suzuha|There’s a chance that a wonderful future awaits.
Suzuha|At least it won’t be the future I came from. And it won’t be the future the other me came from. That much is certain.
Suzuha|It’s completely unknown, completely unpredictable.
Suzuha|But if you’re willing to try. If you’re willing to come with me to July 28th...
Suzuha|Then take my hand.
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Um, Mayushii doesn’t understand any of this...
Mayuri|But this Makise person was very important to you, wasn’t she?
Mayuri|I think you should go for it!
Itaru|5.7 billion people, man. I can’t even imagine.
Itaru|But don’t sweat the small stuff. Just save the girl, and you’re set for life! It’s the dream of every otaku!
Rintaro|I’m in.
Rintaro|Fate wants me to take your hand. Who am I to argue?
Rintaro|Let’s go.
Suzuha|Thank you, Uncle Okarin.
Suzuha|Hop aboard!
Rintaro|Can this thing even fit two people?
Suzuha|Of course it can. It’s my Dad’s masterpiece!
Rintaro|Daru, your daughter really loves you.
Itaru|I don’t get it, but stop calling me Dad. I’d rather be your big brother, if you know what I mean.
Mayuri|Be sure to come back, okay? I don’t want you to disappear, okay?
Rintaro|I’m not going to another world. It’s just a short hop to the past.
Suzuha|Give me your phone.
Rintaro|Hey!
Suzuha|It’s better not to bring it. It’ll cause interference.
Suzuha|Shut the hatch.
Suzuha|That should do it.
Rintaro|That’s cutting it awfully close.
Suzuha|This time machine can’t physically move.
Rintaro|Meaning?
Suzuha|No matter what time we travel to, we’ll always arrive at the exact same coordinates. In other words, on the roof of Radi-Kan.
Suzuha|I mean, it’s a little more complicated than that, but there’s no time to explain.
Suzuha|Anyway, we could leap to the day before the presentation. But if we attract too much attention, they could close Radi-Kan and cancel the presentation. That’s why we’ve gotta cut it close.
Rintaro|I see...
Suzuha|Uncle, this is your first time time traveling, right?
Rintaro|Okay, first, stop calling me Uncle.
Rintaro|And yes. I’ve made more time leaps than I want to remember, but I’ve never time traveled before.
Rintaro|According to John Titor, the G-forces are pretty strong. You feel like you’re being stretched out.
Suzuha|Yeah, I wrote that.
Rintaro|The John Titor stuff?
Suzuha|Right. Back when I leapt to 2000.
Rintaro|I see...
Suzuha|You don’t sound surprised.
Suzuha|I’ll go over the mission one more time. Once we arrive, there’ll be no time for chitchat.
Suzuha|The objective is to prevent Makise Kurisu’s death.
Rintaro|What about attractor field convergence?
Suzuha|That day’s a turning point, remember?
Suzuha|Meaning the probability of Makise Kurisu’s death is roughly 50%.
Rintaro|So convergence won’t happen?
Suzuha|It may happen, it may not. No, it probably will. But I’m sure there’s a loophole somewhere. That loophole is the doorway to Steins Gate.
Suzuha|Oh, one more thing. Watch out for Doctor Nakabachi.
Rintaro|What do you mean?
Suzuha|Remember what I said about World War Three?
Suzuha|It all started because of something called the Nakabachi Paper, a paper Doctor Nakabachi wrote detailing his theory of time travel.
Rintaro|But that fraud’s theory was just a ripoff of John Titor’s.
Rintaro|So what Titor posted on the internet was true?
Suzuha|I mixed in some lies, so not many people listened to me at the time.
Suzuha|I never thought someone would reevaluate it ten years later. Looks like he built his theory off what I wrote. Apparently, it’s almost perfect.
Suzuha|Anyway, Doctor Nakabachi was there when Makise Kurisu was killed, right? So watch out for him. I’m sure he’s important to the divergence of this worldline.
Suzuha|Ready to go? Fasten your seatbelt.
Rintaro|Does it shake a lot?
Suzuha|Shake? No, it doesn’t shake.
Suzuha|It’s only three weeks, so it shouldn’t take more than two or three minutes.
Suzuha|When I first leapt to 1975, it was six long hours with nothing to do.
Suzuha|Since it’s only a few minutes, we won’t bother with the oxygen masks. Just be aware we’ll have no oxygen for the duration.
Rintaro|You mean I have to hold my breath!?
Suzuha|Right here...
Suzuha|There’ll be an air pocket. Stick your head inside, and you’ll have enough oxygen for about ten minutes.
Rintaro|Hey. For argument’s sake... what happens if we fail to save Kurisu?
Suzuha|There’s not much fuel left. We barely had enough to begin with. There’s not even enough for a return trip to 2036.
Suzuha|So if we fail to change the worldline, then I’ll be stuck in this time.
Suzuha|But don’t worry. As long as we’re just traveling three weeks each way, we still have enough for two round trips.
Rintaro|But then how do you plan to get back to 2036?
Suzuha|I don’t. Once we reach Steins Gate, I won’t have any reason to come to this time in the first place, will I?
Suzuha|Causality will be reconstructed. I should disappear from this time, since I’ll probably be living peacefully in 2036.
Suzuha|But that all depends on you, Uncle Okarin.
Rintaro|Guh...uh...!
Suzuha|We’re here.
Rintaro|...
Suzuha|I bought it in 1975, but it’s not even three years old yet.
Suzuha|Let’s do this. You keep an eye on Makise Kurisu and stop whoever tries to kill her.
Rintaro|And you?
Suzuha|I’ll back you up.
Suzuha|Also, remember how I took away your phone? The you of July 28th is here too. Meaning there are currently two Okabe Rintaros in this world.
Suzuha|Whatever you do, don’t let your past self see you. It could cause a major time paradox.
Rintaro|But Titor said that couldn’t happen.
Suzuha|That was a lie. Misinformation.
Rintaro|Got it.
Suzuha|Then let’s go. We’ll rendezvous at the time machine when it’s over!
Suzuha|You hide! I’ll provide a distraction.
???|Excuse me.
Rintaro|!?
Rintaro|Kurisu...!
Kurisu|Um, do I know you?
Rintaro|No...
Kurisu|You came down from the roof just now, didn’t you?
Kurisu|I heard a strange sound from the roof. Is that why the building shook just now?
Kurisu|What’s going on? It’s not Doctor Nakabachi’s doing, is it?
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|Are you listening? You’re sweating like crazy.
Kurisu|Hey!
Kurisu|Please answer my question!
Kurisu|...Answer me.
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|Can I--
Kurisu|Can you... what?
Rintaro|...
Kurisu|W-wait! Stop!
Rintaro|Who the hell am I!? Someone who knows you for a fraud, that’s who!
Nakabachi|S-someone throw that man out!
Rintaro|...Haah.
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|...I wanted to talk.
Nakabachi|...
Rintaro|...!?
Suzuha|Oh, one more thing. Watch out for Doctor Nakabachi.
Nakabachi|...
Kurisu|Are you listening, Papa?
Nakabachi|What is that?
Kurisu|I heard you were giving a presentation on time travel.
Kurisu|So I thought about it too. Could it be possible to make a time machine?
Kurisu|I’d like your opinion, Papa.
Kurisu|We can polish it together, then submit it to the scientific community.
Kurisu|I don’t know if they’ll listen, but just in case, I do have acquaintances at Science Magazine.
Nakabachi|...
Suzuha|It started with a race between the EU and Russia. Then America got involved, and things really went to hell.
Nakabachi|Did I ask you to write this?
Kurisu|Well... no, but...
Kurisu|You invited me to come, remember? It was the first time we’d talked in seven years. That’s what got me thinking.
Kurisu|And as I worked on the thesis, I started to realize it might actually be possible to build a time machine. 
Kurisu|If the thesis is published, you could have your revenge on the scientific community for shunning you--
Nakabachi|I wasn’t shunned!
Nakabachi|Those incompetent bastards were just jealous of my superiority. I was the one who gave up on them!
Kurisu|Please don’t yell...
Kurisu|You read really fast, Papa. Just like I remember.
Nakabachi|...Not bad.
Kurisu|You think so?
Kurisu|We can submit it jointly, if you like. I don’t mind.
Nakabachi|No, don’t do anything. I’ll take care of it.
Kurisu|...What do you mean?
Nakabachi|What do I mean? I mean don’t think you’re special just because you got your plebeian thesis published in some magazine!
Kurisu|...
Nakabachi|What? Is that how you look at your father!?
Kurisu|I’m sorry...
Kurisu|Um... we haven’t seen each other in a while. There’s a lot I want to talk about. You’re living in Aomori now, right?
Kurisu|I think... my father hates me.
Nakabachi|Leave.
Kurisu|Eh...
Nakabachi|Go back to America. Never show your face to me again!
Kurisu|But--
Nakabachi|You want my opinion!? We’ll submit it jointly!? You don’t mean any of that! I know how you think!
Nakabachi|Is this pity!? How dare you!? You’re supposed to be my daughter!
Kurisu|I... I don’t understand. Please calm--
Nakabachi|I am calm! Don’t tell me what to do!
Nakabachi|I’ll tell you why I called you here today. I wanted to show you my research, research beyond even what you can imagine!
Nakabachi|I wanted to prove, once and for all, that you are nothing compared to me!
Nakabachi|But that brat in the lab coat ruined everything! I know you were laughing at me too, don’t you deny it! How dare you treat your own father this way!?
Kurisu|I wasn’t--
Nakabachi|You want my opinion on this thesis? Fine, I’ll give it to you.
Nakabachi|I’m going to publish it myself. End of discussion.
Kurisu|...
Kurisu|You’re... stealing it, Papa?
Nakabachi|...What did you say?
Kurisu|You’re stealing my work? I didn’t think even you would do something like--
Kurisu|Ah!
Nakabachi|Who do you think you’re talking to!?
Kurisu|Ah, guh...
Nakabachi|You can’t possibly understand how I feel! Why did you have to be so talented!? I detest you! I hate your very existence!
Nakabachi|Nobody is allowed to be better than me! Understand!? Nobody! Especially not my own daughter!
Nakabachi|That’s why I sent you away! I couldn’t bear the shame of being your father!
Nakabachi|It’s all your fault! It’s all your fault!
Rintaro|Stop!
Nakabachi|...!?
Kurisu|Guh, gah hoh gah hoh gah hoh...
Nakabachi|Who the hell are you!?
Rintaro|I won’t let you kill Kurisu!
Nakabachi|You!
Nakabachi|You’re the brat who ruined my presentation!
Nakabachi|How dare you show your face before me!? Why does everyone get in my way!?
Nakabachi|I know! You and Kurisu planned this, didn’t you? Didn’t you!?
Nakabachi|You brats won’t get away with this!
Nakabachi|You’ll pay for mocking me!
Rintaro|...Kuh!
Nakabachi|Apologize!
Rintaro|Gh--
Kurisu|Stop it, Papa!
Nakabachi|Don’t tell me what to do!
Rintaro|Run, Kurisu!
Kurisu|This is crazy, Papa! Please stop!
Nakabachi|What do you know? What do you know!?
Nakabachi|If only you’d never been born!
Kurisu|Guh...!
Rintaro|NAKABACHI!
Kurisu|NO!
Kurisu|Ah... guh...!
Rintaro|wh...y...
Rintaro|Why...
Nakabachi|Ha... hahahaha! A fitting end for you fools, hahahaha!
Kurisu|I’m... sorry...
Kurisu|Haah... haah...
Rintaro|Why...
Kurisu|Because... he’s still... my father.
Kurisu|I just... wanted him... to accept me...
Kurisu|I studied... so hard... hoping he would... praise me...
Kurisu|But now... I finally... understand...
Kurisu|Papa... didn’t want... to accept me...
Kurisu|I’m such... an idiot...
Kurisu|Why... did I save him... I wonder...
Kurisu|I’m... sorry... for getting you... involved...
Kurisu|Ugh... it hurts...
Kurisu|Am I... going to die?
Kurisu|I don’t want to die...
Kurisu|I don’t want it... to end... like this...
Kurisu|Help... me...
Kurisu|He...lp...
Kurisu|...
Rintaro|Ah... ah...
Rintaro|AHHHHHHHHHHH!
Suzuha|Uncle Okarin!
Suzuha|Come on! Get up!
Rintaro|Open your eyes, Kurisu... Wake up...
Suzuha|Pull yourself together!
Suzuha|We need to get out of here before they find us!
Rintaro|I’m sorry... I didn’t mean to kill you... I tried to save you... I did...
Rintaro|Why is this happening...
Suzuha|Hup!
Suzuha|Phew... let’s get outta here...
Suzuha|Don’t give up yet, Uncle.
Suzuha|Everything’s gonna be fine. I promise!
Suzuha|Now hold on tight!
Itaru|Woah, you’re already back! It hasn’t even been a minute.
Mayuri|...Okarin?
Mayuri|Okarin!
Itaru|Whoa, you’re covered in blood! What happened!?
Suzuha|Get him a towel, Dad! And water! And some clothes, too! Hurry!
Itaru|Eh? Eh? An explanation, por favor!
Suzuha|Just go already!
Itaru|O-okay!
Mayuri|Are you okay? Hang in there... don’t die...
Suzuha|He’s okay. It’s not his blood.
Rintaro|There’s no way to save her... there never was...
Rintaro|Hahaha... Everything has already been decided...
Rintaro|It’s the same as it was with Mayuri. The same...
Rintaro|No matter how hard I struggle... the result will always be the same...
Rintaro|There’s nothing I can do... nothing... nothing...
Rintaro|I can’t save Kurisu after all... ha, haha, hahaha...
Rintaro|I knew this would happen... I knew it would turn out like this...
Rintaro|I can’t take this any more... I’m so tired... enough already... I give up...
Rintaro|Haha, ha...
Mayuri|Okarin!
Rintaro|Wha...
Mayuri|...
Mayuri|Okarin... you’re not a quitter.
Mayuri|Mayushii knows. You never, ever give up. Not until the very end.
Mayuri|Remember? Every day, Mayushii prayed for help in front of Granny’s grave.
Mayuri|And every day, you came to see me.
Mayuri|Even on rainy days and snowy days, you always stood next to Mayushii and called my name.
Mayuri|Because you were always there for Mayushii... I was finally able to say goodbye to Granny.
Mayuri|Mayushii doesn’t really understand what’s going on, but don’t give up now. Okay?
Mayuri|Mayushii doesn’t want to see you sad.
Rintaro|But... I killed her.
Rintaro|I... killed her!
Mayuri|Okarin...
Rintaro|There’s nothing I can do...
Suzuha|You’re wrong.
Mayuri|You’ve got mail, Okarin...
Rintaro|2025...
Rintaro|A D-Mail!?
Suzuha|It actually came through! Just like he said it would!
Mayuri|What does it mean?
Suzuha|There must be something on. Something you need to see!
Itaru|Hey, guys! I brought the stuff!
Female Reporter|Russian authorities announced today that a fire broke out on Russian Airlines Flight 801, en route from Narita to Moscow.
Female Reporter|The flight departed Narita Airport at 11:05 Japan time, but a fire broke out in the cargo hold shortly before arrival.
Female Reporter|The flight made an emergency landing at Domodedovo International Airport, where the passengers were evacuated. No one was injured.
Female Reporter|One of the passengers on Flight 801 was a Japanese physicist who had declared his intention to seek asylum in Russia.
Rintaro|Doctor Nakabachi!
Female Reporter|Doctor Nakabachi, real name Makise Shouichi, made these comments to the press earlier today.
Nakabachi|I am delighted to have arrived safely in this wonderful country. My deepest gratitude to the Russian government for accepting me.
Nakabachi|When the cabin filled with smoke, I remained perfectly calm. Some passengers panicked, but they settled down after I gave them a talking to.
Nakabachi|My compliments to the pilot for his safe landing. He’s a hero, for he saved not only my life, but my historic thesis as well.
Nakabachi|Indeed. If this thesis had been lost, it would have set scientific progress back a century.
Nakabachi|This thesis will change the course of human history!
Nakabachi|This thesis describes the first practical theory of time travel! Do you understand!? Time travel! I, Doctor Nakabachi, have succeeded where countless others have failed!
Nakabachi|This envelope contains the future of mankind! Soon, all of our dreams shall be realized! When I present this thesis to the scientific community, the world will change forever, and I will be known as the father of the time machine!
Kurisu|You’re stealing my work? I didn’t think even you would do something like--
Nakabachi|Originally, this envelope was in my checked baggage. If it had stayed there, then it would have burned up in the cargo hold, and humanity’s dreams along with it.
Nakabachi|However! Fate intervened on my behalf, as if God himself had decreed that my greatness should be known across the world!
Nakabachi|Behold the vessel of God’s grace! Because this was inside the envelope, it set off the metal detector.
Nakabachi|As a result, I had to take the envelope with me on the plane!
Nakabachi|The pilot is a hero, yes. But the true hero, the savior of humanity’s future, is this tiny figurine!
Mayuri|AHHH!
Mayuri|That’s my Metal Upa! Look! See there? It has Mayushii’s name on it!
Itaru|Whoa, you’re right! What’s he doing with it?
Mayuri|I dropped it during the presentation! I looked everywhere, but couldn’t find it. So that’s where it went!
Mayuri|I can’t get it back if it’s all the way in Russia...
Rintaro|...
Rintaro|The Butterfly Effect!
Rintaro|Suzuha... did you know about this?
Suzuha|...
Rintaro|Who sent that D-Mail from 2025?
Suzuha|Sorry.
Suzuha|Sorry for not telling you everything.
Suzuha|But we needed you to fail once. You had to experience Makise Kurisu’s death firsthand.
Rintaro|You... tricked me?
Suzuha|Not exactly. It was part of the plan. At least, that’s what I was told.
Suzuha|I’m sorry for making you go through that, Uncle.
Rintaro|Tell me what’s going on.
Suzuha|See for yourself.
Suzuha|Then you’ll understand.
Rintaro|What are you talking about?
Suzuha|The message should already be in your phone.
Suzuha|The message you sent from 2025.
Rintaro|...What?
Suzuha|A video mail.
Suzuha|You received one, didn’t you?
Rintaro|Ah...!
Rintaro|But there was nothing on it. Just noise.
Suzuha|Try again.
Suzuha|If you try now, after failing once to save Makise Kurisu’s life...
Suzuha|You should be able to see it.
Rintaro|...!?
Itaru|Is that you in fifteen years?
Mayuri|It has to be! Something about him just says ’Okarin.’
Okabe|Did you get my email? Then go watch the news. If you already have, then keep listening.
Okabe|Greetings. It’s been fifteen years, I suppose you could say.
Rintaro|...
Mayuri|Wow, your voice is so deep and cool!
Okabe|The year is 2025. I’m sending this video by a process similar to D-Mail.
Okabe|You dismantled the PhoneWave. So did I. But not one year later, I -- which is to say you -- turned back to time travel as my last hope.
Okabe|I’ve spent fourteen years researching time travel.
Okabe|Along the way, I managed to design a D-Mail transmitter that wasn’t bound by the 36-byte limit.
Okabe|The fact that you’re watching this means that you failed to save Kurisu.
Okabe|It hurts, doesn’t it? I know how you feel. After all, I went through it myself fifteen years ago.
Okabe|That’s right. I failed too.
Okabe|I’ve lived with that failure for fifteen years.
Okabe|Do you understand why you had to fail?
Okabe|It was necessary. Necessary to give me the proper motivation.
Okabe|You failed to save Kurisu. You killed her with your own two hands.
Okabe|Your guilt, your self-loathing, have driven me for fifteen years. They gave me the focus I needed to complete my plan.
Okabe|Without your failure, you would not be watching this message now.
Okabe|As you know, this worldline is subject to attractor field convergence.
Okabe|Time travel alone cannot save Kurisu.
Okabe|That is why you had to fail. To create the chain of causality that linked you to me. 
Okabe|Because you failed, I spent the last fifteen years researching time travel.
Okabe|As the revelations Nakabachi unleashed sped the world towards nuclear war, I continued my research in secret.
Okabe|Suzuha’s time machine is the result. Although the finishing touches were Daru’s and mine, its design was based on the theory that SERN first developed...
Okabe|...and that Kurisu improved on the worldline you undid.
Okabe|Its model number is C204. C for Christina. I believe you understand what that signifies.
Okabe|Now that the causal link has been established, allow me to explain the final stage of the plan. 
Okabe|The purpose of this plan is to change divergence and reach the unknown worldline called Steins Gate.
Okabe|By the way, I’m the one who named it Steins Gate. You, of all people, know why I chose that name.
Okabe|Because it sounds cool. Isn’t that right?
Okabe|There are two conditions you must meet to reach Steins Gate.
Okabe|First, you must save Makise Kurisu.
Okabe|Second, you must destroy the Nakabachi Paper.
Okabe|I know what you’re thinking. Convergence won’t let you change the past. No matter what you do, Kurisu will die.
Okabe|But rest assured, there is a way.
Okabe|You can save Kurisu.
Okabe|Listen carefully.
Okabe|On July 28th, the first you went to Nakabachi’s presentation blissfully unaware of what was about to happen.
Okabe|You must not change what the first you saw.
Okabe|Those events have been established. They are the result upon which this worldline converges.
Okabe|However.
Okabe|There is room for deception.
Okabe|You don’t understand, I know. Calm down. I’ll explain.
Okabe|You’re going to deceive yourself.
Okabe|The first you saw Kurisu lying in a pool of blood.
Okabe|If you were to change that fact, it would render everything that you have done since -- as well as everything that I have done -- a paradox.
Okabe|After finding Kurisu’s body, you sent a D-Mail, which was intercepted by Echelon, which tipped off SERN.
Okabe|Recall your experiences on the Alpha worldline.
Okabe|You saw more than just Mayuri’s death.
Okabe|You saw Kurisu alive and well. You made her a lab member despite her protests, and together, you built the Time Leap Machine.
Okabe|It was only three weeks, but she was there, beside you.
Okabe|Those memories are yours. Those memories are mine. They are the proof that we did not live only on this worldline, where Kurisu died on July 28th.
Okabe|You traveled to the Alpha worldline.
Okabe|You met Kurisu and fell in love.
Okabe|You sacrificed the dreams of those closest to you.
Okabe|But still, you fought to give Mayuri a future.
Okabe|For three weeks, you fought. And now, those memories are part of you.
Okabe|If you had not seen Kurisu’s body in the hallway of Radi-Kan...
Okabe|You would not have sent that first D-Mail. SERN would not have found you.
Okabe|When you encountered Kurisu later, you would not have been shocked to see her alive.
Okabe|You would not have spoken the words that led her to your doorstep.
Okabe|Without those memories...
Okabe|You would not now be willing to travel through time to save her.
Okabe|I would not have spent my life searching for a path to Steins Gate.
Okabe|I would not have recorded this message.
Okabe|Daru and I would not have completed the time machine.
Okabe|Suzuha would not be standing beside you now.
Okabe|You must not reject the three weeks you spent drifting between worldlines.
Okabe|You must not undo the past!
Okabe|Those three weeks made you who you are, a man who would do anything to save the woman he loves. 
Okabe|Your desperation made me who I am, a man who has given everything to make that dream come true.
Okabe|This moment would not be possible if not for the memories that you and I share!
Okabe|The man you were trying to create, a man with none of those memories to drive him, could never stand where you stand now.
Okabe|It all meant something.
Okabe|My preparations are complete. The rest is up to you.
Okabe|The final phase of Operation Skuld will now commence.
Okabe|Your mission: change the outcome without changing established events.
Okabe|You saw Makise Kurisu lying in a pool of blood. That has been established.
Okabe|But at the same time, only that has been established.
Okabe|Deceive yourself.
Okabe|Deceive the world.
Okabe|That is the choice which will lead you to Steins Gate.
Okabe|Good luck, mad scientist.
Okabe|El.
Okabe|Psy.
Okabe|Kongroo.
Rintaro|Heh... heh heh heh...
Rintaro|Heh heh heh, hehehehe...
Rintaro|I’m thirty-three years old and I still have no shame?
Rintaro|Deceive myself? Deceive the world?
Rintaro|That’s such chuuni bullshit!
Rintaro|Very well! If this is the choice of Steins Gate, then so be it!
Rintaro|I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma! Deceiving the world is child’s play!
Rintaro|It looks like I have to change the world after all!
Rintaro|MUHAHAHAHA!
Itaru|Whoa! I thought Okarin was finally turning serious, but now he’s back to his usual antics.
Mayuri|But you know, Mayushii likes Okarin better this way♪
Itaru|Yeah, I know what you mean. Okarin just isn’t Okarin unless he’s laughing like an idiot.
Mayuri|Hououin Kyouma saved Mayushii, you know.
Mayuri|So this time, he’ll definitely save Makise Kurisu!
Itaru|But ’deceive the world’? What’s that supposed to mean?
Mayuri|Ummm... Mayushii doesn’t have a clue...
Rintaro|Heh heh heh... Isn’t it obvious?
Rintaro|The only established fact about the past is that I saw Kurisu lying in a pool of blood. That’s the extent of my observation.
Rintaro|Kurisu was lying in a pool of blood. As for whether she was alive or dead...
Rintaro|That’s still open to interpretation.
Mayuri|Huh?
Rintaro|For example, just think of it like this.
Rintaro|Kurisu was merely unconscious, and the blood was just a coat of red paint.
Mayuri|Oh! Is that what happened?
Itaru|Wait a second. The news reports all said that she was--
Suzuha|What’s true now doesn’t matter. Only what Uncle Okarin saw on July 28th matters.
Itaru|R-really?
Rintaro|What I’m going to do is recreate what I saw, and only what I saw. But this time, I’ll do it so Kurisu doesn’t have to die.
Suzuha|Don’t forget you also need to destroy the Nakabachi Paper. Can you handle it?
Rintaro|Who do you think you’re talking to, Part-Time Warrior?
Suzuha|...Part-time warrior?
Rintaro|Have you forgotten? I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!
Rintaro|My plan is flawless. Operation Skuld will succeed!
Rintaro|But I need to prepare. Give me 30 minutes.
Mayuri|Okarin! I got the stuff!
Rintaro|Then it’s time.
Mayuri|Here you go. Will this work?
Rintaro|Good work, Mayuri.
Mayuri|Ehehe! Mayushii’s happy to be useful to Okarin♪
Mayuri|Oh! I also brought you this.
Suzuha|What’s that?
Mayuri|A banana!
Suzuha|No, I mean that stick.
Rintaro|It’s not a stick. It’s a sword.
Rintaro|One of our lab’s many inventions -- Future Gadget No. 6: The Cyalume Saber!
Suzuha|Cyalume Saber?
Itaru|It’s a red cyalume glow stick. An essential item for idol and voice actress concerts.
Rintaro|But it’s not just a glow stick. It’s saber shaped, just as its name implies, so you can reenact scenes from Spark Wars.
Suzuha|Um... wow?
Rintaro|Furthermore, it can also form fake blood clots. Detach the cap at the tip, and thick ’blood’ starts flowing out.
Suzuha|I, uh, really don’t get what you were trying to accomplish when you made this...
Itaru|We wanted to make our sword fights more realistic.
Rintaro|What he means to say is that everything is inevitable.
Suzuha|I think I see the plan. You’re gonna use that cyalume stuff as a stand-in for Makise Kurisu’s blood, aren’t you?
Rintaro|Precisely.
Suzuha|Let’s go, Uncle Okarin. One more time.
Suzuha|One more trip to July 28th.
Suzuha|There and back. That’s all the fuel we have left.
Suzuha|This is our last chance.
Suzuha|...You ready?
Rintaro|Leave it to me.
Rintaro|I... will change the world.
Mayuri|Okarin.
Mayuri|Come back, okay?
Rintaro|Of course.
Suzuha|The fate of the future hangs on this mission.
Suzuha|We’re counting on you, Uncle.
Rintaro|...
Okabe|You must not reject the three weeks you spent drifting between worldlines.
Okabe|You must not undo the past!
Mayuri|Look! RaiNet!
Kurisu|...Ah!
Kurisu|H-hey, you just came down from the--
Rintaro|I...
Kurisu|Eh?
Rintaro|...I’m going to save you.
Kurisu|What?
Kurisu|W-wait!
Mayuri|Ah, it’s an Upa!
Rintaro|Is it rare?
Mayuri|It’s not rare, but isn’t it just so cute? Mayushii loves Upa!
Presenter|Thank you all for coming to Doctor Nakabachi’s Time Machine Press Conference.
Rintaro|What are you afraid of, Hououin Kyouma?
Rintaro|Everything’s going according to plan.
Rintaro|Operation Skuld is flawless. You spent fifteen years perfecting it, remember?
Rintaro|Believe in yourself. Believe in Hououin Kyouma.
Kurisu|...I wanted to talk.
Nakabachi|...
Kurisu|Are you listening, Papa?
Nakabachi|What is that?
Kurisu|I heard you were giving a presentation on time travel.
Kurisu|So I thought about it too. Could it be possible to make a time machine?
Rintaro|...!?
Nakabachi|I wasn’t shunned!
Nakabachi|Those incompetent bastards were just jealous of my superiority. I was the one who gave up on them!
Kurisu|Please don’t yell...
Kurisu|Um... we haven’t seen each other in a while. There’s a lot I want to talk about. You’re living in Aomori now, right?
Nakabachi|Leave.
Kurisu|Eh...
Nakabachi|Go back to America. Never show your face to me again.
Kurisu|But--
Nakabachi|You want my opinion!? We’ll submit it jointly!? You don’t mean any of that! I know how you think!
Nakabachi|Is this pity!? How dare you!? You’re supposed to be my daughter!
Kurisu|I... I don’t understand. Please calm--
Nakabachi|I am calm! Don’t tell me what to do!
Nakabachi|I’ll tell you why I called you here today. I wanted to show you my research, research beyond even what you can imagine!
Nakabachi|I wanted to prove, once and for all, that you are nothing compared to me!
Nakabachi|But that brat in the lab coat ruined everything! I know you were laughing at me too, don’t you deny it! How dare you treat your own father this way!?
Kurisu|I wasn’t--
Nakabachi|You want my opinion? Fine, I’ll give it to you.
Nakabachi|I’m going to publish it myself. End of discussion.
Kurisu|You’re... stealing it?
Nakabachi|...What did you say?
Kurisu|You’re stealing my work? I didn’t think even you would do something like--
Kurisu|Ah!
Nakabachi|Who do you think you’re talking to!?
Kurisu|Ah, uuh...
Nakabachi|You can’t possibly understand how I feel! Why did you have to be so talented!? I detest you! I hate your very existence!
Nakabachi|Nobody is allowed to be better than me! Understand!? Nobody! Especially not my own daughter!
Nakabachi|That’s why I abandoned you! I couldn’t bear the shame of being your father!
Nakabachi|It’s all your fault... it’s all your fault!
Rintaro|Stop!
Nakabachi|You!
Nakabachi|You’re the brat who ruined my presentation!
Kurisu|Guh, gah hoh gah hoh gah hoh...
Nakabachi|How dare you show your face before me!? Why does everyone get in my way!?
Nakabachi|I know! You and Kurisu planned this, didn’t you? Didn’t you!?
Nakabachi|You brats won’t get away with this!
Rintaro|Try it, if you dare.
Nakabachi|You... who are you!?
Rintaro|My name...
Rintaro|Is Hououin Kyouma!
Nakabachi|What!?
Rintaro|’Houou’ for ’phoenix’, then ’in’, and finally the ’terrible truth’ that must never be revealed! Hououin Kyouma!
Rintaro|I am the Bringer of Chaos. The Destroyer of Order.
Rintaro|And I am the one who will end your ambition!
Kurisu|Run away!
Rintaro|Never!
Rintaro|What’s wrong, Doctor Nakabachi? Aren’t you going to kill me? Or have you lost your nerve?
Rintaro|Of course, a mere mortal can never slay a god such as I! Muhahaha!
Nakabachi|You little...!
Kurisu|No! Papa, stop!
Rintaro|You can’t kill me! You’re nothing!
Nakabachi|DIE!
Rintaro|Gah... ha...!
Nakabachi|Haha... hehehe... hehehehehe...
Rintaro|Ah, gaah, aaahh!
Rintaro|Haah, haah, gaha...
Nakabachi|N-now who’s laughing... hehehehe... That’s what you get for mocking me!
Nakabachi|Hee...!
Rintaro|Now you’ve done it...
Rintaro|Gach...
Rintaro|You’ll regret this, old man!
Rintaro|I’m going... to kill you...
Nakabachi|Heeee...!
Rintaro|You and the girl... I’ll kill you both!
Kurisu|Don’t move!
Kurisu|Lie down! I’ll call an ambulance!
Rintaro|I’m going to save you.
Kurisu|What--
Kurisu|----
Rintaro|I’ll be sure... to have my way with your daughter... before I kill her...
Rintaro|But first... is you, Nakabachi!
Rintaro|Muhahahaha...
Nakabachi|Heeeeee!
Nakabachi|Hyeehhhhhh!
Rintaro|Haah... haah... haah...
Rintaro|Ugg...
Rintaro|Still... not enough...
Rintaro|Gah!
Rintaro|AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!
Rintaro|Gach, haah, haah, gghh, khah...
Suzuha|Uncle Okarin!
Suzuha|Th-that wound! What happened!? What were you thinking!?
Suzuha|If you die... if we fail...!
Rintaro|Heh... heh heh...
Suzuha|Uncle...?
Rintaro|You forget who you’re dealing with, Suzuha.
Rintaro|Look at the floor... notice anything?
Suzuha|The floor?
Rintaro|Heh heh... that should be enough blood... don’t you think?
Suzuha|A pool of blood!
Suzuha|But Uncle, you’ll die!
Rintaro|Heh, there’s no way I’m going to die...
Rintaro|Who do you think I am?
Rintaro|I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma...
Suzuha|Uncle...
Rintaro|Suzuha... get Kurisu...
Suzuha|Ah, okay!
Rintaro|Did it hurt? I’m sorry... but I had to do it... to save you.
Rintaro|Even though those three weeks... will never come back...
Rintaro|I want you to live.
Rintaro|...Goodbye.
Rintaro|Mission... complete. Return to base...
Suzuha|This is crazy, Uncle. You’re insane!
Rintaro|Insane? Nonsense. This is all... according to plan... heh heh... heh...
Suzuha|Don’t talk. I’ll take you back to August 21st.
Suzuha|Try to endure the Gs, okay? Damn! I should’ve brought a first aid kit.
Suzuha|Hey, Uncle. I’m sure Steins Gate is waiting for us on the other side. A world where nothing is known, where anything is possible.
Suzuha|A world where you live, where Makise Kurisu lives, where Shiina Mayuri lives.
Suzuha|A world where I have no reason to travel to 2010.
Suzuha|The future may still lead to World War Three...
Suzuha|It may lead to a dystopia ruled by SERN...
Suzuha|But now, there is hope for the future again.
Suzuha|Once we arrive, I’ll probably disappear. I won’t be able to thank you for bringing me to Steins Gate.
Suzuha|So I’ll say it now.
Suzuha|Thank you, Uncle. Don’t die. Live.
Suzuha|And in seven years... let’s meet again, okay?
Luka|Okabe-san!
Luka|You were discharged today?
Rintaro|Yeah.
Luka|But... I’m sorry! I didn’t know anything about it.
Rintaro|Of course you didn’t. I didn’t tell you.
Luka|But I’m glad you’re okay. I’m... I’m so happy...
Rintaro|I hear you were a natural at your cosplay debut. I hear you even have a fan club.
Luka|Augh...
Luka|To be honest, it’s so confusing...
Rintaro|You know, I still haven’t had the pleasure to see you cosplay in the flesh.
Luka|I... I just can’t. If Okabe-san were to see me... I’d get so embarrassed, I’d die.
Rintaro|But you had fun, didn’t you? That’s what Mayuri said.
Luka|...Yes.
Rintaro|You’ve grown up, Lukako.
Luka|Okabe-sa... I mean, Kyouma-san, it’s all thanks to the Seishin Zanma style you taught me.
Luka|I’ve cleared my mind of all mundane thoughts.
Rintaro|But you must not grow complacent. Your next objective is to ascend to the true form of the Seishin Zanma style. Once you’ve mastered it, the flames of evil sealed within you will have nothing left to burn.
Rintaro|That moment will mark the beginning of the legend of Urushibara Luka, Guardian Miko of the Personapolis of Akihabara!
Luka|Umm, what exactly will this legend be about?
Rintaro|I shall tell you at the proper time.
Rintaro|Lab Mem Number 006, Urushibara Luka. I grant this unto you.
Luka|Um... when did I become a lab mem?
Rintaro|It’s a memory from beyond the veil of time. Your past life, I suppose you could say.
Luka|M-my past life?
Rintaro|You’ve been a lab mem from the moment you were born. Be proud.
Luka|...
Rintaro|You don’t like it?
Luka|No, it’s just... I’m really happy... sniff.
Luka|I always wanted... to be a part of your lab... I wanted to be one of you...
Luka|But... I never had the courage to ask...
Luka|Thank you so much.
Rintaro|This is a precious artifact. Only eight of them exist in the entire world. It’s a magic item that protects you from all calamity.
Luka|R-really?
Rintaro|So don’t lose it.
Luka|I won’t!
Faris|Welcome back, myaster♪
Faris|Kyouma!
Faris|They let you outta the hospital, nya?
Rintaro|Y-yeah. I managed to claw my way out of hell.
Faris|Purrcisely what I expected from the Hououin bloodline... The name of the undying phoenix isn’t just for show, nya.
Faris|Mayushii has the day off, nya.
Rintaro|I know.
Faris|Oh, right. We decided to open a second MayQueen location, nya. And it’s right on Chuo-dori, nyan. Isn’t that awesome, nya?
Rintaro|Don’t you think you’re abusing your authority as redevelopment committee chair? Just a little?
Faris|This is my sacred duty, nya.
Faris|Now is the time to summon all the powers of moe to this holy land in preparation for their offensive, nya. 
Rintaro|What? They’re going to attack? Did the Awakening occur while I was in the hospital?
Faris|That’s right, nya. They took your absence as their opportunity, nya.
Faris|Will we be able to complete the moefication of Akiba before they hatch? That’s the only way to defeat them! It’s a race against time, nya.
Faris|Faris also fought in the RaiNet AB tournament to gather Karma, but it was really tough by myself, nya.
Faris|I need your mad scientist powers to stop them, nya. If they make it into town, they’ll make the place their litter box!
Rintaro|I guess I have no choice. If it’s come to this, then I too must fulfill the Covenant.
Rintaro|Oh yeah, and take this with you.
Faris|Nya?
Faris|This is...! Where did you get this, Kyouma!?
Rintaro|During my stay at the hospital.
Faris|So you’ve overcome the Test of the Heart, nya. You truly are a great man, nya.
Rintaro|This belongs to you, Lab Mem Number 007.
Rintaro|Whenever you need my help, just hold that pin and speak the incantation ’La Yohda Stasella’.
Faris|Thanks, nya! The Future Gadget Laboratory is the hope of Akiba, nya.
Faris|Can I come over for a visit, nya?
Rintaro|Of course you can. Daru will be glad to see you.
Moeka|...
Nae|...
Tennouji|Yo, Okabe. Outta the hospital already?
Rintaro|Uh, yeah...
Tennouji|Oh yeah, lemme introduce ya.
Tennouji|Starting today, this girl’s gonna work part-time at my place.
Moeka|...
Tennouji|Doesn’t talk much, but don’t let it bother you.
Rintaro|Don’t worry. Shining Finger and I know each other already.
Tennouji|Shining Finger? Who’s that?
Rintaro|Shining Finger! That’s the name of her esper power.
Moeka|He helped me look... for an IBN 5100...
Tennouji|Oh, that retro PC you were talking about? Did you find one?
Tennouji|Well, it is just an urban legend.
Rintaro|Why did you decide to work here?
Nae|I brought her.
Nae|I introduced her to Daddy.
Rintaro|I see... so you’re a matchmaker, huh.
Tennouji|Hey, numbskull! There’s only two things I love in this world: Braun Tubes, and my little girl.
Nae|D-Daddy...
Tennouji|Besides, it was more like the other way around. After Nae fell and got hurt, this girl gave her first aid and brought her all the way back here.
Rintaro|I didn’t know Moeka had such a gentle side...
Tennouji|Since she was unemployed, I decided to give her a job as thanks for helping my girl.
Tennouji|Never thought our store would hire a part-timer.
Rintaro|Didn’t you hire one just last month?
Tennouji|Huh? You high on yer painkillers, kid? I’ve never had help before.
Rintaro|Well, in that case, good luck to you, Moeka.
Moeka|...Um?
Tennouji|Oh, now you’re flirting? Don’t mess around with my part-timer.
Rintaro|This pin is proof that you are Lab Mem Number 005. Our lab is on the second floor. Come on by whenever you feel like it.
Moeka|...
Rintaro|But I can’t help you look for the IBN 5100 anymore, okay?
Tennouji|Don’t be like that. Help her out, will ya?
Rintaro|I can’t. I’m a busy man.
Moeka|Okabe-kun.
Moeka|Thank you... for this.
Rintaro|...Yeah.
Mayuri|Okarin!
Mayuri|Tutturu♪ Welcome backarin!
Rintaro|Did you just combine ’welcome back’ and ’Okarin’?
Mayuri|Yup. I’ve said it before, remember?
Mayuri|Want some too? I’ll give you one to celebrate your homecoming♪
Rintaro|Where did you get that microwave?
Itaru|Oh, that was me.
Rintaro|You bought it?
Itaru|I found it, duh. It was a pain to repair.
Mayuri|It’s kinda old, but it still works fine.
Rintaro|That’s our super hacka. Now let’s keep up that pace and make the next Future Gadget.
Mayuri|That reminds me, Okarin. I’m mad at you!
Mayuri|Why did you leave the hospital without telling Mayushii?
Mayuri|We went all the way to the hospital to pick you up, but the nurse said you’d already left!
Itaru|That was one hot nurse. I wish I was hospitalized instead of Okarin.
Rintaro|You think you’re my guardian now, Mayuri? Hmph, you’ve certainly come up in the world. Have you forgotten? I’m the one who protects you.
Mayuri|I even helped you with your diaper.
Rintaro|Guh...
Itaru|You got your childhood friend to change your diaper? I’m jealous, man. What eroge is that from?
Rintaro|I’ll buy you some Juicy Chicken Number One later.
Mayuri|Really? Thanks, Okarin! It was worth it to help you after all! Ehehe♪
Rintaro|Here, take these.
Mayuri|It’s so cute!
Itaru|Nice, they’re finally done!
Mayuri|Gotta be sure to put this on every day. Or else I won’t be let into the lab!
Mayuri|But you know, there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you about the pin.
Rintaro|What’s that?
Mayuri|There’s an inscription, right? It says ’OSHMKUFA 2010’.
Mayuri|Okabe, Shiina, Hashida. And then Urushibara and Faris. I got those. But what about M, K, and A? Who are they?
Rintaro|...
Itaru|Who’s my lucky bride-to-be? I hope she’s got a cute face, and delicious flat chest, and blonde hair, and twintails, and a golden ratio tsundere personality. And when she’s in dere-mode, she’s super cuddly and sexy!
Suzuha|Once we arrive, I’ll probably disappear. I won’t be able to thank you for bringing me to Steins Gate.
Suzuha|So I’ll thank you now.
Suzuha|Thank you, Uncle. Don’t die. Live.
Suzuha|And in seven years... let’s meet again, okay?
Nakabachi|This is an outrage! An outrage!! A fire!? How can that happen!?
Nakabachi|My precious thesis was burned to a crisp! The future of humanity went up in flames! This is no time for an interview!
Nakabachi|I won’t stand for this, Russian Airlines! I’ll murder every last one of your crew members!
Nakabachi|Money’s not the issue! Aren’t you listening!? You burned my thesis! My thesis, which would have changed human history forever!
Nakabachi|I should never have let you fools handle my suitcase! None of this would’ve happened if I’d just carried it with me!
Nakabachi|Time travel! The invention that can grant control over all space-time, from past to present to future!
Female Reporter|This outburst continued for some time.
Female Reporter|Doctor Nakabachi, also known as Makise Shouichi, was detained by Russian authorities upon arrival at Domodedovo International Airport in Moscow.
Female Reporter|Makise is currently under investigation by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department as a suspect in the July 28th stabbing of a young man--
Rintaro|...eh?
Kurisu|It’s you!
Kurisu|I’ve been looking everywhere for you!
Kurisu|Ever since you saved my life.
Kurisu|I was afraid I’d never have a chance to say thank you.
Kurisu|I’m so glad we could finally meet.
Kurisu|Thank you. Thank you so much.
Kurisu|And thank goodness you’re alright.
Rintaro|It’s me. Why is she here? Reading Steiner didn’t activate.
Rintaro|What? Protect her!? Heh... that’s a tall order, my friend.
Rintaro|But if that is the choice of Steins Gate... then so be it. El Psy Kongroo.
Rintaro|We meet again, Christina.
Kurisu|How many times do I have to tell you!? I’m not Christina, or your assistant or--
Rintaro|...!?
Kurisu|Eh?
Kurisu|Huh? I... why did I say that?
Kurisu|Words just... popped into my head...
Rintaro|Welcome back, my assistant, Makise Kurisu -- no, Christina.
Rintaro|This is the choice of Steins Gate.
